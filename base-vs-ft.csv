[doctor] yeah that sounds painful and so when did this occur
[patient] it it occurred over the weekend on saturday
[doctor] and have you been able to to walk at all at all or no
[patient] a a little bit but it's definitely swollen and it's definitely painful

[doctor] have you ever had any type of injury to your knee before and it is this the left or right knee
[patient] it's the right knee no it's the first time i've had any knee injuries

[patient] yeah pretty much i can get the full range just feels a little tight and will hurt
[doctor] okay alright and for diagnostics so your x-ray so there's no fracture appreciated no bony abnormalities so that looks alright so let me tell you a little bit about my impression and plan with this so you have a knee contusion so for treatment we'll we need to rest that apply ice you know two three times a day for twenty minutes at a time take some nsaids or you know nonsteroidal anti- inflamma medication such as ibuprofen every six to eight hours as needed so i just wan na really get some rest with that if that does n't improve then we can go ahead and maybe come back in and we might do some physical therapy as well i do n't know i'm not sure i like this one all that well any do you have any questions on that
[patient] no sounds very good
[doctor] okay let's venture a little bit more because i need five minutes so where so where were you skiing at

[doctor] well washington sounds nice i have n't been there but it sounds like it's pretty nice area to be in and they have a lot of maple syrup there do n't they produce a lot of maple syrup
[patient] they do they do have a lot of maple syrup and it's it's it's interesting that the the winter actually is n't their busiest time for vacation or vacations or it's more into your spring into your fall with hikers and all the outdoor activities there's actually a very impulsive torist during the summertime which i never knew but one of the locals have told me that they do actually better business during the summer so the hikers kayakers and the maple syrup in the fall and everything so

"Hello?
Hello.
Hello there. It's uh Doctor here. How can I help you this afternoon?
Ohh, I just got a terrible headache since mid-day.
Um on the left side. It's just making me feel so ill. I just feel like I need to vomit.
I'm sorry to hear that. Um can you tell me a bit more about the headache?
Well you know, I noticed some zig-zag lines in my vision a few minutes before the headache started.

Mm-hmm.
My vision blurred. Um, you know, it just
I, yeah. Pain's just horrible. Just making me feel so unwell. Um
Mm, OK. And
just want you to do something.
Well, let's try our best. Let's try and get you, let's try and get you well, soon. Um you mentioned it's on your left hand side. Is that right? And it started at mid-day, a few hours ago.
Yeah.
OK. Um did the pain come on quite suddenly? Or was it more of a gradual build up?
Don't know, really. It just happened.
OK. And are you able to describe what kind of headache it was? For example, was it throbbing, or was it more of a sharp pain?
Yeah, I guess it's, yeah I guess it's throbbing, um on that left side.
And is it moving anywhere else, at all?
No, but it's worse when I move.
Uh OK. Is that when you move your neck?
Well, like if I lean forward, or like move my head or neck, yeah, headache gets worse.
OK. Um
I'm just really worried. Like I've just been googling and like I've read, you know if your headache gets worse if you move, it could be a sign of brain cancer.
OK. Is that all you're worried about?
cancer.
Is that, is that all your main worries today?
Ohh yeah, yeah and I'd like, you know
My, my friend's mum, she she recently died of a brain tumor. So, it's really concerning me actually.
Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that. I can, I can understand why it's affecting you. Um
But why don't we, why don't we take a good history first, and let me examine you. And then we can have a little chat afterwards, and see what's going on here.

Um so you mentioned a few things. You mentioned a headache. You also mentioned some disease, like Lyme's, uh before the headaches came on.
And your vision has been blurry as well. Is that right? Is that , is that on both eyes, or just in left, left eye?
Yeah.
Eh, feels like it some days.
Both eyes, OK. Have you any difficulty with seeing bright lights, at all?
Yeah well I'm , wearing sunglasses right now. It's just, you know, the light's really hurting my eyes.
Ohh, I see OK. Um and you mentioned that you felt quite nauseous. Have you vomited at all?
Yeah.
I vomited twice.
Twice, OK. Um earlier today, OK. Um, any temperatures or fevers?
Um, no I don't feel feverish.
OK. Um, any other funny skin rashes that you may have noticed?
No, I haven't noticed anything like that.
OK. Um fine. Um, and do you normally get headaches?
Um, I'm not really prone to them, no. No but I did, I did have a similar headache a few weeks ago.
OK. And what happened then?
Just similar.
How long did it last for?
Couple of days.
Did you do anything that made it better?
Um yeah I had to take painkillers, and had to go go to bed and rest and
Yeah.
couple days off work, and I work in the fashion industry. And you know, they're wondering what's going on, like I have to take sick days.

Yeah. Yeah.
I need to get back to work today. But you know, what if it is a brain tumour? What's gonna happen with my future and my career?
Yeah. Yeah.
You know, really about this. never had headaches like this before. Like why should I get them now?

Yeah, sure. I mean I can see your concern obviously is a lot, there's a lot of worry there.
Um but you know let let let, as I said let's take it step by step, um to see exactly what the cause of these headaches are first. Um, I'm just going to ask you some, um very uh yes no questions if that's OK, ma'am. Um
Um have you noticed any problems with your speech at all, any difficulties with your words?
No.
Any problems with your arms and legs? For example numbness or weakness?
No.
Any difficulty with balance, your balance or coordination?
No.
OK. And have you had any injuries to your head? Have you had a fall recently, or been knocked on the head?
No.
OK, alright. Um and and you're feeling otherwise OK. So, for example your um
Uh your your breathing's OK? You're not feeling breathless, or
No, OK. Um do you have any other medical history I should be aware of?
No, nothing.
No. So for example, have you had, has anyone told you you've had migraines in the past?
No.
No, OK. Do you
No. My mum, my mum has, has migraines. But I've, I've not been diagnosed.
OK.
Right, my next question was that of family history. Is there anything in the family? So apart from migraines, is there anything else? Is there anything related to brain, for example?
as well.
What was that, sorry?
My mom has an underactive thyroid as well.
thyroid as well. OK. Um OK any other problems with for example, the brain, or? Um you mentioned brain cancer. Any other family history of ?

No.
No, OK. Um in terms of medications, do you take anything on a regular basis?
Um I take the pill, Microgynon.
OK. And how long have you been on that for?
three months.
Three months, OK. And is that mainly for contraception, or is that for something else?
it's for contraception.
OK, alright.
That's something you meant to have a little discussion about today as well. Um
Uh well my next question was about um your social, your situation at home. You mentioned you work in the fashion industry.
And your work, is your job quite stressful at the moment?
Yeah it's really stressful, actually.
Have you been
having problems at like work, you know managers like putting a lot of pressure on me to deliver and, uh yeah it's not a good time.
. Is it getting you down?
I don't feel down, just a little bit stressed.
OK, alright. And what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress, normally?
Nothing really.
OK. Do you do much in the way of exercise?
No.
No, OK. Um who's at home with you?
Um, I live on my own.
OK. Um are you coping OK at the moment?
Fine.
Yeah? OK. Um do you smoke at all? and do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
No.
No.
OK, alright. Um, so normally at this I'd like to kind of proceed to examination. Um
That's um based on your story, um I wonder whether you may, uh may have a migraine, uh migraine type headache. Uh it sounds
Um, very classical of that, of that nature, the the the headache on one side, throbbing nature, the nausea, vomiting, um sensitivity to bright lights.
Uh, I'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious, such as meningitis, or indeed
Brain cancer, I know that was a big worry of yours initially. Um
thank you, uh thanks so much. I was so worried that I had cancer. And, ohh now you say migraine. Yeah I guess my mum has similar symptoms to me and yeah, it does make sense.
yeah. Yeah.
Well, I hope that puts your, you know, mind at ease. Um, certainly this is the second migraine you've had in the space of a month. Um,
So I think, moving forwards, there's a couple of options. I think keeping a headache diary would be quite important, uh to see exactly what's triggering these headaches.
And in terms of trying to treat your headaches today, some strong painkillers would be advisable. So, think about Paracetamol, or even Co-codamol.
Um, and some anti-inflammatories, such as Ibuprofen and Naproxen. How's that sound to you?
K that sounds good.
Um and uh, you know if your headaches were to become more persistent, then we could maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the first place, something prophylactic medicines.
then we could have a discussion next time I see you next week, perhaps.
OK.
OK.
OK. Um, now a couple of things I want you to think about is, you know if your symptoms aren't getting better next two three days, or indeed they're getting worse.
I'd like you to come back and see me, um straight away if possible. So if your headache's getting worse, not responding to medications
Or your um neck pain is getting worse, or you develop any weakness in your arms and legs, or your vision, then I want you to come back and see me straight away. OK?
OK.
Does that sound all OK?
Doctor, that's great.
Great. Any questions for me?
No. Thank you.
OK. Have a good day!
K thanks. Bye!

"Hello.
Hello. Hi, I'm Doctor Jacob and welcome to Babylon. How are you doing?
I'm OK, thank you. Um, not feeling that great actually.
Good.
Alright. I can't see your face properly , just, yeah that's it. That's good. Thank you. So, I'm sorry to hear that. But just before we start, is it alright if you could confirm your name for me please?

I'm Mary Jane Grey, um.
Date of birth?
Date of birth, um nineteen eighty.

OK. And your address for me please?
Um, I live on SW four zero NG.

That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location, and we can have a confidential conversation.
Yeah.
OK. So you've mentioned that you're feeling dizzy. , yes.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm feeling I'm, I'm yeah, I'm feeling very sick. It's probably because i'm feeling dizzy, um the the room is sort of spinning, um.

And I, I can't, I can't walk properly. Uh, well I can walk properly but not straight, um.
and my ears are buzzing a bit. I'm just, they're feeling a bit off.
Mm-hmm.
OK, ear's buzzing. So when did it all start?
Started probably about two hours ago maybe. but I, I, um, I had a a similar sort of thing about a month ago, um
But I didn't really think anything of it, 'cause it it settled quite quickly. Um, but this has been going for a bit more now.

OK. So you said, you mentioned it started a few hours ago. So did it start? What were you doing?

Um, I was just actually making my husband some breakfast, um.
And I, yeah, I just suddenly felt very fuzzy and dizzy, um, and a bit shaky.
OK. So you mentioned, like the room spinning around?

Yep.
OK. And is, how long does it last for? Or is it there now, continuously now?
Yeah it's, it's there, the whole time.
So it's there now for the past two hours you'd say, yeah?
Yep.
OK. Did you have any kind of viral illness in the recent past, past couple of weeks?

No.
No cold, cough, nothing.
No, I've been pretty healthy I think, um, yeah.
Yeah, OK. Um, you've mentioned that you have a, some ear buzzing kind of thing. Any kind of ear pain or ear discharge, anything like that?
No, nothing.
OK. Do you have a temperature at all?
I don't think so, um.
OK, right. You also mentioned that you can walk, but you're not walking straight. Why is that? Is it because
I think just 'cause the room feels like it's moving a bit. Um
Feels like to move . That's why you're feeling like you're a bit unsteady, yeah?
I'll look .
My, my legs and arms and everything are working fine I just, I don't feel like I'm stable. My, the room is spinning.
So there's no weakness of your arms and legs. OK.
No.
K. Right. Um, so you mentioned you had something like this a month ago. So how, how, how long did that episode last for?
Probably only about five, ten minutes.
OK, right. And do you have any problems hearing at the moment? Like, is it muffled or something?
No.
It's just a bit of a buzzy noise in my ears, but otherwise I can hear everything.
OK. Righty-ho.
OK. So, have you been physically sick?
No, but now I'm feeling very sick.
Nausea, OK.
Righty-ho. And, I don't have much information of your past medical history. So is there any medical conditions you'd like to tell me, surgical, medical conditions?
Um, I've had premature ovarian failure, um, and I've taken HRT.
OK charting premature hearing failure. OK, and um any other medications at all?
No.
OK, do you have any allergies at all?
No.


OK. Right. OK so , talking to you today, um, in the , the most common um, you know, diagnosis we would you're suffering from at the moment is something called labyrinthitis. Yeah?
OK, that's when your middle ear...there is something um, some inflammation going on there, and there is some imbalances in the crystals there in your middle ear.
OK, so what the most important treatment is actually giving you some kind of middle ear stability so that you won't feel as if you're going around in a boat, kind of feeling.
OK? So that's what we need to . Because to actually make you function a bit more, we'll start you on certain medications.
I would still like you to be seen by one of our doctors to take a look inside your ears to just make sure. So this is like just symptomatic relief like you have a fever we just give paracetamol. So just to, you know, make you able to come and see one of the doctors and things like that.
while you're with the doctors, we'd like to do your blood pressure, just examine your, you know, you know, how your walking and everything is.
OK, while we're waiting, while you're waiting on seeing the doctor if you double up any weakness of your legs or arms or, or, you know, a sudden headache.
OK.
Any of those symptoms, or you start being violently sick with it, then you know, you would need to take your to A and E.
OK.
But if not, wait for the appointment for the doctor to examine you um and we'll take it from there.
So i'll, i'll send the a prescription at cross pharmacy looks like it's the Lloyd pharmacy on our system. Is that correct?
Yeah.
Yeah. So we'll send you across that prescription. Um, it's called , yeah? It's one tablet three times a day. So I'll give you about ten days worth.
In the interim, obviously in the next few days, you'll get to see one of my doctors and we'll have to just take it from there.
OK, thank you so much.
Any questions at all?
Um, can you take, do you need to take those tablets with food? Or can you just take them any time?
It doesn't really matter, you can take it, because sometimes, you know, you get the symptoms as soon as you wake up, so probably you'll feel a bit sick to eat anything so might as well just take the tablets.

OK, that's great. Thank you so much, that's so helpful.
Just make sure you call support to book that appointment, OK?
I will, thank you very much.

"[patient] hey bruce so see here my my notes here is you here he had positive lab work for hep c so how're you doing today
[doctor] i'm doing okay but i'm a little bit anxious about having hep c i've really surprised because i've been feeling fine they had done it as you know a screen as just part of my physical so i'm really surprised that that came back positive
[patient] okay so in the past have any doctors ever told you that you had hep c
[doctor] no never that's why i'm i'm so surprised
[patient] okay so just you know i need to ask do you have a history of iv drug use or you know have known any hep c partners
[doctor] i mean i used to party a lot and even did use iv drugs but i have been clean for over fifteen years now
[patient] okay that that's good i mean i'm i'm happy that you were able to to kick that habit i know a lot of my patients that i see you know they're still dealing with with those dements so i'm i'm i'm happy that you're able to do that so hopefully we can get you better okay
[doctor] thank you
[patient] so what about alcohol use is that something that you used to do a lot
[doctor] i did i did i mean i i still have a beer here and there everyday but not as much as i used to
[patient] okay and have you ever smoked before
[doctor] i do smoke i smoke about one to two cigarettes per day i've cut down a lot but i'm just having a hard time kicking those less too
[patient] yeah yeah and that that's something i've got to work on too because hep c along with smoking you know both of those are n't are n't good so hopefully we can help you out you know if your pcp has n't prescribe something for you already and possibly we can we can do that for you as well
[doctor] okay
[patient] so do you have any other medical conditions
[doctor] no i'm actually other than that i just had my physical and i'm not taking any medications no i'm i'm pretty good otherwise
[patient] okay and what conditions would you say run in your family
[doctor] i have high blood pressure diabetes and depression
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so let me go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good and on general appearance you appear to be in no distress no jaundice on the skin on your heart exam you have a nice regular rhythm rate
[patient] regular rate and rhythm with a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur is appreciated on your lung exam your lungs are clear without wheezes rales or rhonchi on your abdominal exam bowel sounds are present your abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly
[doctor] hepatosplenomegaly yes let me i will change that one
[patient] splenomegaly and on your muscle exam there is no gait disturbance or edema so i did we i was able to review your your results of your recent lab work and your hcv antibody test was positive so your your liver panel we did one of those and it showed an elevated ast at thirty nine but your alt albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits so that's pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you do have hepatitis c so your initial labs were consistent with that hep c diagnosis and so you know i do n't know if you read much about hep c but hepatitis c is a viral infection that does affect your liver and you've most likely had it for several years now it it it most patients do n't see symptoms until years later so the next step that i would like to do is just confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work so that includes checking your hep c rna and your hcv genotype and i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and we will do that by ordering an ultrasound elasto elastography with this information we will we we will be able to know how we can proceed as far as treatment right so how does that sound
[doctor] i hmmm so i do have a wife and kids so should i be worried about them
[patient] okay yeah so we can start with the same screening that you had for august first so we'll just let's do that hep c antibody test and i'll actually help you set up those appointments with your your family doctor and then we can just see you back in three weeks and based on the results you know we will take action as needed okay
[doctor] okay that sounds good
[patient] alright
[doctor] alright
[patient] my nurse will be in with those those orders
[doctor] alright thank you
[patient] alright thanks

"[doctor] next patient is randy gutierrez . date of birth , 8/10/2020 . please use review of symptoms . all text to write . physical exam , auto text uri .
[doctor] hello , how are you doing today ?
[patient_guest] we're okay , thank you .
[doctor] that's good to hear . so , how many days has randy been feeling sick ?
[patient_guest] well , i would say it started around supper time last night .
[doctor] last night , okay , and what's been going on ?
[patient_guest] well , he started to get a runny nose .
[doctor] okay , and is he stuffy too ?
[patient_guest] yeah . yeah .
[doctor] okay , and have you noticed , is his mucous clear right now ?
[patient_guest] it is , it is right now , yes .
[doctor] okay . and , does he also have a cough ?
[patient_guest] yes , but it's not barky .
[doctor] and does he act like he has a sore throat or is he pulling on his ears ?
[patient_guest] well , i know he's been pulling on his ears , yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] you know , he also , he's also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too .
[doctor] okay . and , any fever you've noticed ?
[patient_guest] i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 .
[doctor] okay . so , a little bit of a low-grade fever there , definitely . and , how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ?
[patient_guest] yes , he did . yeah .
[doctor] and how about this morning ? did he eat his breakfast ?
[patient_guest] uh , this morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] and then he got another bottle , and he barely ate that . um , i offered him cereal and he would n't eat that either .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] so , he varies i guess .
[doctor] how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps , or does he have pretty good energy ?
[patient_guest] mmm , it seems like he's irritable .
[doctor] irritable because he is n't feeling good ?
[patient_guest] yeah . he is energetic , but it seems like he ca n't go to sleep , like , he's fighting it really hard .
[doctor] okay , and just for the chart , is there anyone , anybody else exposed to him who has been sick ?
[patient_guest] yes , his older sister's been sick .
[doctor] thank you .
[patient_guest] we also had a play date with my nephew , who i learned later had a sinus infection .
[doctor] and what medication have you tried for him ? anything at all ?
[patient_guest] um , i've been doing the saline mist in his nose .
[doctor] good , good . that's a good choice .
[patient_guest] i did give him tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when i took the sleeper off of him , and we had the ac on in the house , but his whole body was sweating .
[doctor] i see . and , any other medications ?
[patient_guest] we did put some baby vick's on his feet last night to try and help him breathe . and , i also used the humidifier .
[doctor] okay . that's good .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ?
[patient_guest] i've been using the cradle cap brush , and then i use regular aveno shampoo .
[doctor] is it a dandruff shampoo ?
[patient_guest] no , i do n't think so .
[doctor] okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps .
[patient_guest] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] can you take a big breath randy .
[patient_guest] where's mama ?
[doctor] do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too .
[patient_guest] yeah , it's okay buddy .
[doctor] excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over .
[patient_guest] dino , you're doing so good .
[doctor] all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down .
[patient_guest] hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay .
[doctor] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like .
[patient_guest] all right . thank you .
[doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine .
[doctor] you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , got it .
[doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough .
[patient_guest] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?
[doctor] yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine .
[patient_guest] okay . so , zarbee's for the stuffy nose .
[doctor] yes , zarbee's .
[patient_guest] and then you said , uh , which medicine to give him just in case ?
[doctor] i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister , and just hang onto it , um , just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , um , but since , um , if it's gon na be the weekend , and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night , i'd rather you have just what you need on hand .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] right , does that make sense ?
[patient_guest] yeah , yeah . that makes sense .
[doctor] okay , great . and that way you do n't have to share , um , with his sister .
[patient_guest] right , okay .
[doctor] and since he's about half her size , we'll do half the dose , which is a half a teaspoon .
[patient_guest] okay . will this information all be in the papers ?
[doctor] yes . and so , if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for five days .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] yeah , that's the only thing it wo n't say is , "" as needed , "" or anything like that .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , understood , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[patient_guest] and the cradle cap ?
[doctor] what i would do is use something like either head & shoulder's , or selsun blue , or nizoral ad . now , do n't get the extra strength stuff , just use the regular strength . um , cradle cap , it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff . so , those shampoos will help get rid of it . it's not an immediate thing 'cause they , um , they are all dead scales , and you still have to brush them off . so , continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil , or something that will help get the scales out , and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well . use it two times per week , not every day , but maybe twice a week .
[doctor] so , two days between shampooing , use what you normally use any other time . and then , often , within six weeks or so , you'll notice that the-the cradle cap is just , um , not coming back anymore . but , he has to be careful because it's not ph balanced for eyes . so , just make sure when you're rinsing his hair you avoid his eyes .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] all right . and , if it keeps getting worse , definitely let us know .
[patient_guest] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] good . and , since they do n't have covid-19 , you can go right ahead and check out .
[patient_guest] okay . and both appointments in the week ?
[doctor] correct . we'll see you all then . bye randy , feel better .
[patient_guest] all right , great . thank you so much .
[doctor] you are welcome , and have a good rest of your day .","Randy Gutierrez, DOB 8/10/2020, presented with a 1-day history of upper respiratory symptoms. Symptoms began around supper time last night and include rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, clear mucus, and a non-barky cough. The patient has been pulling on his ears and rubbing his nose, with irritability and difficulty sleeping. A low-grade fever of 100.3°F (rectal) was noted. Appetite is variable; he consumed 7 oz from a bottle this morning but refused cereal and only partially consumed a second bottle. Energy level is decreased, with irritability and restlessness.  

Family history reveals the older sister is ill, and a playdate with a nephew with a sinus infection occurred. No other household members are ill.  

Medications administered include acetaminophen (Tylenol) 0.4 mL (approx. 160 mg) orally for fever, saline nasal mist, Vicks Baby Rub on feet, and a humidifier. Cradle cap is present; the patient is using a cradle cap brush and Aveeno shampoo (not dandruff shampoo).  

Physical exam: No acute distress. Ears show no signs of acute otitis media. Nasal mucosa is clear with bilateral congestion. No conjunctival injection or rhinorrhea. No abnormalities noted on the head or neck.  

Diagnosis: Viral upper respiratory infection (URI) with possible sinus involvement. No evidence of bacterial infection at this time.  

Plan:  
- Continue saline nasal mist, humidifier, and monitor for worsening symptoms.  
- Advise watchful waiting; no antibiotics prescribed.  
- If barky cough develops, administer 0.5 tsp of the patient’s sister’s cough medication (half dose due to size) for 5 days.  
- Avoid honey; recommend agave nectar for sweetness.  
- Continue cradle cap care with Head & Shoulders, Selsun Blue, or Nizoral AD (regular strength), 2x/week. Use a soft brush and baby oil to remove scales. Avoid contact with eyes.  
- Follow-up in 7 days.  
- Monitor for fever >102°F, persistent cough, or signs of dehydration.  
- No restrictions for activities; no evidence of COVID-19.  

Discharge instructions: Ensure adequate fluids, rest, and avoid sharing medications with siblings.

[doctor] aw , that's great to hear .
[patient] yeah , there were a couple days there i took an extra one , just because there was a little extra pain in my feet . and i do have a desk job , so when i have a day off where i'm moving around a lot they do tend to hurt a bit more .
[doctor] okay . how many times did you do that ?

[doctor] okay . so it sounds like we're still on track for discontinuing the prednisone . we'll do that today and you can let me know how it goes on your next visit . and how about the methotrexate , do you think that helped with your joint pain ?
[patient] yeah , definitely . because i went to get my covid shots , um , but from the letter i got about it , it said that it could interfere with the vaccine , you know , reduce the efficacy . so i did n't take it on the week that i got the first shot .
[doctor] okay . and what happened ?
[patient] i felt absolutely horrible until i took it again a week later .
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that . and- and what did you do about the second dose ?

[patient] well , i just wanted to know why i was getting all these bruises here , so like when i bump myself . i do n't know where they're coming from .
[doctor] okay . that's probably from the prednisone , it can increase bruising .
[patient] okay . i did n't know that . um , i do n't even feel it when it happens , they just show up .
[doctor] yeah . unfortunately that can happen , but we're working on discontinuing that so let's see if the bruises do go away .

**Patient Name**: Judy Gomez  
**Medical Record Number**: 869723  
**Date of Birth**: 5/7/1961  
**Date of Visit**: [Date Not Specified]  

---

**Hospital Course**  
Ms. Gomez presented for ongoing management of psoriatic arthritis. She reported successful reduction of prednisone to 1 tablet daily, with occasional extra doses (1–2 times weekly) for intermittent foot pain, particularly on days with increased ambulation. The physician confirmed discontinuation of prednisone today, with follow-up at the next visit to assess tolerance.  

Methotrexate was discussed; the patient discontinued it prior to the first COVID-19 vaccine due to concerns about efficacy, resulting in significant side effects (e.g., severe pain, fatigue). She resumed the medication after consulting the hotline, with resolution of symptoms. The patient was advised to schedule blood work for monitoring, which was not previously arranged.  

The patient inquired about unexplained bruising, which the physician attributed to prednisone use. Physical examination revealed mild joint pain in the knees and feet, with preserved range of motion and nail ridges consistent with psoriatic arthritis.  

---

**Discharge Diagnosis**  
Psoriatic Arthritis  
- **Active Management**: Continue methotrexate; discontinue prednisone.  
- **Monitoring**: Watch for side effects of methotrexate (e.g., fatigue, bruising).  
- **Prednisone Discontinuation**: Monitor for adrenal insufficiency or flare-ups.  

---

**Disposition Plan**  
1. **Medications**:  
   - Discontinue prednisone immediately.  
   - Continue methotrexate as prescribed.  
2. **Follow-Up**:  
   - Schedule blood work for monitoring (to be arranged at the front desk).  
   - Return for follow-up in 3 months.  
3. **Patient Education**:  
   - Report any new bruising, joint pain, or side effects.  
   - Avoid stopping methotrexate without provider guidance.  
4. **Vaccination**:  
   - Discuss timing of future vaccines with the provider, considering methotrexate use.

"Hello? Hi. Um, should we start? Yeah, okay. Hello how um. Good morning sir, how can I help you this morning?
Hello, how are you?
Oh hey, um, I've just had some diarrhea for the last three days, um, and it's been affecting me I need to stay close to the toilet. And, um, yeah, it's been affecting my day-to-day activities.
Sorry to hear that. Um, and and when you say diarrhea, what'd you mean by diarrhea? Do you mean you're going to the toilet more often? Or are your stools more loose?
Yeah, so it's like loose and watery stool, going to the toilet quite often, uh and like some pain in my, like, lower stomach?

Okay. And how many times a day are you going, let's say, in the last couple of days?
Um, probably like six or seven times a day? Yeah.
Six, seven times a day. And you mention it's mainly watery. Have you noticed any other things, like blood in your stools?
No, no blood, yeah, just watery and loose stool.
Okay. And you mentioned you've had some pain in your tummy as well. Whereabouts is the pain, exactly?
Yep.
So in my lower abdomen, so, uh, like, um...yeah, just to one side.
One side. And what side is that?
Uh, on the left side.
Left side. Okay, and can you describe the pain to me?
Yeah, it feels, um, like a cramp, like a muscular cramp, and, um, yeah i feel a bit uh weak and shaky.
Okay. And is the pain, is that, is it there all the time, or does it come and go?
Uh, it comes and goes.
Come and go. Does the pain move anywhere else, for example towards your back?
Uh...no, just maybe my stomach.
Okay, fine. And you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak and shaky as well. What do you mean by shaky? Do you mean you've been having, uh have you been feeling feverish, for example?
Yeah.
Um, yeah, it doesn't feel like -- yeah, it just makes me feel weak. I haven't had a fever, um, at the moment, but I did notice um a temperature when the symptoms started, so, um, yeah around about three or four days ago.

You measure your temperature then?
Yeah, I uh I didn't mention my temperature, no, but I felt, um, just a bit hot. And, y'know.
Okay. Okay. Any other symptoms like sweating, or um, night sweats? No? And, uh, any vomiting at all?
Uh, no.
Yeah, so um, I vomited at the start of the symptoms but now um I've stopped vomiting.
You stopped vomiting, okay. And was your vomit, I know it's not a nice thing to talk about, but was it just normal food colour Yeah. And there was no blood in your vomit, is that right?
Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit, yeah. No no blood, no. Yeah.
No, okay. Um, and um, any any other symptoms at all? So you mentioned tummy pain, you mentioned diarrhea, you mentioned your vomiting, uh, anything else that comes to mind?
Yep. Um, I had a loss of appetite, um, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids.
Okay.
Okay, so you're drinking fluids. Um, what kind of foods have you managed to eat, if anything?
Yep.
Um, just soups, and, uh, yeah, light foods. Like smoothies and, yeah, liquid foods mainly.
Okay. Fine. Um, and sir these started three days ago the symptoms. Are you aware of any triggers which may have caused the symptoms uh to kick on. So for example, think like takeaway foods or eating out or being around other people with similar symptoms.

Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, um, uh, but other than that I've, yeah, been, uh, eating normally. Nothing unusual here.
Okay.
Do you remember where you ate?
Um, yeah, I ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Yeah.
Okay. Anyone else unwell with similar symptoms?
Um, so no one else in the family, so a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms.
Okay, okay. Fine. Um, alright. And uh, in terms of your , your overall health, are you normally fit and well? Or, uh
Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.
Okay. And, is your asthma well-controlled?
Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.
Fine. And you don't have any other tummy problem, bowel problems I should be aware of?
No.
No, okay. Um, and apart from the inhalers, do you take any other medications?
Uh, no, no other medications.
Okay, fine. And in terms of just your day to day life, you said it's been affecting your life, um, in what way has it been affecting your life?
Yeah.
Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.
Okay.
Yeah.
And have you, are you currently working at the moment?
Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.
Would, would work.
Okay. Have you been going into work the last three days, or have you been at home?
Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.
okay. That must be difficult for you then.
fine. And you said, you mentioned you live with your wife and two children, is that right?
Yes, yeah.
Right, alright. Um, just a couple of other question we need to ask, sir. Um, do you smoke at all?
Uh, no, I don't smoke.
And do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no.
Okay. so um, er normally at this stage I like to um, examine you if that's okay, but um, um, but but having listened to your story, sir, I think uh, um, just to recap for the last three days you've been having loose stool, diarrhea, a bit of tummy pain uh mainly on the left-hand side, um and vomiting and fever and you're quite weak and lethargic um, you mentioned you had this Chinese takeaway as little as three days ago and I wondered whether that might be the cause of your problems.
Yeah.

Okay.
Um, it seems like you may have something, uh, called gastroenteritis, which essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your uh of your tummy.

Uh, mainly caused by viruses but there can be a possibility of bacteria uh causing its symptoms. Um.
Yeah.
Yeah.
At this stage, uh, what, what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management. So, um, I don't think you need anything like antibiotics. It's really just, um, making sure you're well hydrated, so drinking fluids.

Mm-hmm.
Um, there are things like Dioralyte you can get from the pharmacy, which uh it's um it helps helps replenish your minerals and vitamins.
Okay.
Um, and if you are having vomiting diarrhea I would say recommend that in the first, you know, first couple of days.
Yep.
If you are feeling feverish and weak, eh taking some paracetamol, uh, two tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help.
Yep.
I will certainly advise you to take some time off work, actually I know you're quite keen to work but I would say the next two, two to three days as the infection clears from your system to take some time off and rest.
Okay.
Yeah.
Um, I'll admit if your symptoms haven't got better, you know, in in three to four days, I'd like to come and see you again.
Okay, sure.
Because if it is ongoing then we have to wonder whether something else caused your symptoms.
Yep.
Uh, and we may need to do further tests like um taking a sample of your stool so we can test that.

Um, etcetera etcetera.
Yep, sure, yep.
How's that sound?
That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.
Do you have any questions for me?
Um, no, no further questions, no.
Okay, and is uh is the treatment plan clear?
Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.
Great. Well, I wish you all the best.
Okay, thank you. Bye.
Thank you. Bye bye.","**Clinical Note**

And who do you live with at home?
Sorry?
Who do you live with at home?
My partner.
And what's your job, day-to-day?
I'm a designer.
Have you had to miss any work at all?
Uh, no, but I don't feel that, I'm finding it really hard to , to do any of, my work, or, normal things.
OK. Um, and do you smoke at all normally?
No I don't.
Do you drink any alcohol regularly?
No.
Um, and any other drugs?
No.
No, OK. Um, I mean the fact that you haven't had headaches before, um, is, is unusual the fact that they've developed. Is there anything you think's changed? Any increased stress, , change in your diet or lifestyle?
Not that I can, not that I can think of.
OK. So, what we would suggest is, trying a slightly stronger, pain relief.
Uh, so, similar to Ibuprofen, but taking instead of Ibuprofen not at the same time, and taking that regularly with food.
OK.
Um, hopefully that will settle it down. You can take Paracetamol along with that.
Yes.
Try and um, take rest, have lots of good hydration.Um, but if the pain's getting worse, or you get new symptoms, fever, rash, vomiting, neck stiffness.
Um, or you keep getting episodes of the same type of thing, then we need to speak to you, and, and make a plan for, for what we can do next.
OK.
Thank you.
Have you got any other questions?
How long do you think it will last for?
Well I should think it should down, if it's getting worse or not settling in the next day or two.
Then certainly give us a call back, if, when you've tried the medication that I've prescribed from the pharmacy.

OK.
OK?
Thank you.
All right then. Thanks a lot. Bye.

The other thing which is important to do is to drink, lots of water. So, two and a half to three litres a day.

Um, you can get some cranberry juice and take, drink that as well, that sometimes helps. And also some, sachets um, which you can get from the chemist, some sachets which just help change the acidity of your urine. So I, I can put the details of that on your notes.
Yeah.
OK then.
Um, if you feel like your pain is getting worse or not settling, you get lower back pain, um, or you're getting a high temperature, or you have any problems actually passing urine. Then it's very important that we speak to you again.
OK.
Um, the other thing is that if it becomes a, common, thing or a recurrent problem. Then we need to talk to you again about it.
So, do I have to call after I finish my course of antibiotics.
No, not if you're better. If you're, if you feel like your symptoms get worse at any point, or they're not resolving with the treatment. Or you keep getting a similar, um, you keep getting a similar, problem, reccurently. Then it's important for us to talk, talk to you in more detail about that.
OK.
Yeah.
OK then.
Um, have you got any other questions?
Uh, no. Uh, where will be the pharmacy I'll be picking up, my medication from?
Um, so have you already requested a pharmacy through Babylon?
Yes I did.
Can I just check that with you?
Knightsbridge, Practice.
OK, that's fine. So the antibiotics, that I'm gonna prescribe, um, will go through to that, pharmacy.
How soon?
And then , you'll be able to pick them up from there.
How soon is that gonna be, at the practice? In five minutes?
Um, I would give it longer than that. Give it a, an hour or so.

Perfect, OK. Um, are you in a private place where you're OK to speak at the moment?
Yep.
OK, great. Um, so how can I help you today?
Um, so, just been having some, um, problems with my hearing, I can't really hear very well, and my , noticed that my face has been feeling a bit numb recently.
Right, OK. OK. And how long has this been going on for?
Um, it's been, it's been a few weeks now. Um, been about three weeks or something.
Right, OK. And, is this just on one side, or both sides?
Just one side, just on my left side, I've noticed that the hearing's kind of gone down a bit.
Right, OK. And your face feeling numb, where exactly is that? Which part of your face? Can you, can you show me with your finger?

Yeah, so again it's the left side, it's kind of like around my left ear, and kind of, along here. So like, my jawline's just all feeling a bit numb round here.
Right, OK. OK. Um, has anything else happened, um, in this time? Any other symptoms you have at all?
Not that I, not that I've noticed, .


I think, occasionally noticed a, ringing in my ear. Um.
Some, some ringing in your ear. OK.

And, have you had any difficulty speaking?

Have you noticed any problems with your vision, at all?
No, that's all good.
OK. Uh, and do you have the numbness present right now?
Uh, yeah. It kind of, kind of, there quite often, so, all the time. So yeah, right now it feels very, doesn't feel like when I touch this side of my face.
Sure. Sure, OK. Alright, um, just going back to the kind of feeling in, in the ear, um, do you have any discharge coming from that ear at all?
No, nothing, nothing coming out.
K. Any pain in the ear, or from the ear?
Uh, no, don't think so.
Right, OK. And um, have you had any fever at all?
No, nothing like that.
And, do you, um, have any itchiness in the ear?


Do you use cotton buds to kind of clean your ears out?
Pardon? Ohh, no, no, no, don't use cottons buds, like that.
No. Alright. OK. Alright. Um, need to, need to ask a few other general questions. Um, do you have any other illnesses at all?
Um, I've, well I've got kind of, been told I have polyps in my nose in the past and, occasionally get them kind of .
Um, that, that's all fine and, you know I take a Rennie's if I need to, and if my nose polyps are playing up I've got a spray. Um.

Other than that I think they said, ages ago, I had something called, can't quite remember but, labyrinthitis, something like that, but again, nothing, nothing ongoing.

Sure. Sure, OK. So, are you on any regular medication? You mentioned the spray for your nose.
Yeah, so, no, uh, I only take the, spray for my nose when I need it for, and um, sometimes take like Rennies, but I just get that from the chemist.
Sure. and, and the spray for your nose, where do you get that from? Is that from a doctor?
Uh, yeah, they gave me a prescription ages ago.
Yeah. Do you remember the name of the spray, at all?
Unfortunately I don't, sorry.
that's alright. That's alright. Uh, and you're not on any other medication at all?
No.
No, OK. Do you have any , any allergies to any medication?
Uh, no just Latex.
Latex, OK. Alright, that's good to know. Um, and um, in terms of your family, are there any kind of illnesses within your family at all?
My brother had, Neurofibromatosis, I think it is. Um, other than that everyone else is OK.
Right, OK.
OK, good. That's good. Um, and in, in terms of your own kind of background now, are you, are you working at the moment?
Yeah, so I'm a, I'm a jockey, um, but, because of all the kind of, these symptoms I've been getting, especially sometimes when I get a ringing, I can feel a bit dizzy. Ohh, I've just had to do far less training.
So, kind of beginning to, yeah, impacting work, um, a little bit now.
OK. So you have to excuse my ignorance, you mean, jockey like with horses? Is that what you're talking about? Yeah. Alright, OK. Fine. Um, great. Um, uh, and, uh, do you live alone?
Yeah, yeah.
Um, I, uh, live with my partner.
Uh, OK. Right, um, do you have any pets at all at home?
No, no pets.
OK, fine. OK so, alright. Um, Is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about what's been going on, recently?
Uh, no, just like, like I said, like the ringing um, occasionally and, when I get that I can sometimes feel a bit dizzy but, the main thing is really the, lack of hearing, and the numbness that's got me like, yeah, no idea what's going on there.

OK, fine. Alright. Um,
So, , what I think , go on.
I mean, there was just like, there was one thing I think just, 'cause I can panic and you can look online, get a bit, frantic.

, I guess what I'm trying to think is, you know, is there something particularly serious that, you know, will need to be sorted and.
Obviously, really, anything can just make you really frantic . Hopefully nothing , so serious I will die from it, I don't know I just, I think got myself in a pickle.

OK. so um, uh, obviously we're limited in terms of assessment via the video, uh, portal.
Mmm.
um, from what you've told me, this doesn't seem to be you know, anything um, that you're gonna die from. However, I would like you to be assessed in a clinic today.
OK.
OK? I ,would like you to come to one of my clinics. I would like a GP to assess you. what you're, what you're describing might be something called Bell's Palsy. OK? Um,
OK.
Yeah.
We can go into that, explaining what that is, if um, if that's confirmed on, on physical examination. But um, that's not usually a life-threatening problem.
OK.
But, um, part of the reason why I'd like you to come in, it's just that we can do a, a what we call a, a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on, and confirm that might be the diagnosis. Have a look, have a look inside the ear, see if there's any, , anything to see within the ear.
OK.

So, um, um, so, in answer to your question. No, I don't think that you need to worry about that, I , think you know , preliminarily I can, I can reassure you.
OK.
However, , in order to definitively reassure you, I, I think you need a physical examination today, OK. , so what I wanna do, is I'm gonna send a message to our admin team, I'll ask them, to book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, that's fine.
OK.
Um, within Central London. OK, and then you can ring the , the support team number, I'll leave that number in your notes. And you can ring them after five minutes, and then they'll slot you in to a place that's convenient for you, OK.
OK.
Yeah.
, that's fine.
All right. So, someone will see you, and hopefully you will be able to reassure further but, please make sure the appointment gets done today.
OK, yep, I will do, that's fine. Thank you very much.
All right then. OK. Nice to see you. Take care.
Bye bye.

[doctor] alright so i've looked at your vitals and honestly they look great you know your blood pressure i see is one twenty five over seventy that's almost textbook respiratory rate we are seeing you at a smooth eighteen excuse me your temperature you're running normal ninety seven . one you're you're satting at a hundred percent so and then your pulse so that's interesting like you're you're going at like about sixty beats a minute so i think they're i think we're doing pretty well i'm gon na go ahead and listen to your heart on your heart exam i do n't appreciate any like murmur rub or gallop we have a nice regular rate and rhythm for your lung exam i do appreciate a little bit of stridor that's really interesting but i do n't hear any wheezes or rales so that's great for your i know this sounds weird but for your abdominal exam i do n't appreciate any rebound no guarding on your skin exam i do n't sorry like on your your head everything looks symmetrical your your mucosal membranes are normal you do n't feel hot to touch so that's great but i'm gon na do my foot exam okay so on the right foot there is some bruising of the plantar and dorsal aspects of the foot there is associated swelling when i touch on your midfoot here does it hurt
[patient] no uh uh
[doctor] okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments i know this is a lot do you have any questions
[patient] yeah do i have to do the surgery
[doctor] so i'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot if you do n't it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flat-footed you can also develop arthritis in that foot so yes i i i highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with
[patient] i just hate that word surgery doc
[doctor] i know
[patient] you know it scares me every time i mean especially with my foot i want to be able to walk again and so i just get really worried i mean how long is the procedure usually too
[doctor] so it's actually
[patient] have to be in the hospital
[doctor] no no no no no it's actually a day surgery and you'll be able to go home the same day and then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week you'll be in a cast and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do so the procedure itself is not very long you will and so like since you will be able to go home that's great but you wo n't be able to drive especially since you're saying are you left handed or right handed
[patient] i'm right handed
[doctor] yeah so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with so no you're gon na you're gon na need somebody to take you home but what
[patient] i mean
[doctor] uh uh
[patient] does that mean i'm out for the rest of the season i mean i wan na be able to get back and play again i really am i'm getting a little better so i
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] i really wan na keep on playing my tennis with my friends but
[doctor] yeah so unfortunately yes it does mean that you're out for the rest of the season but hopefully we can get you a great get you to a set up well for next season and in the meantime i think i'm gon na recommend after surgery that we get you to physical therapy i think that that's gon na be a really great way to like kinda strengthen the muscles and make sure that you're at peak performance before we put you back out there
[patient] i suppose so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] thank you
[doctor] no problem so i do wan na let you know that there are some risks associated with any kind of surgical procedure i'm gon na bring you some paperwork and that my ma is gon na go over with you such as like risks of bleeding loss of sensation nerve damage all those things will be discussed with you and if you have any questions leading up to and even after your procedure go ahead and ask them and we'll be more than happy to help with that okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] good

"Hello.
Hello?
Hi, hi.
Hi, can you hear me?
, I can hear you well.
Hi, my name is Doctor Gohil. I'm one of the doctors that works at Babylon.
Can I, can I check your name and date of birth, please?
Uh, hi doctor. My name is.
Yes my, my name is uh, Roberto Mendoza. And, uh, I'm, I was born on the first of January, of um, uh, nineteen ninety two.
OK.
OK, and are you in a space that's quiet and you're able to talk?
Ohh sorry, I um, of nineteen ninety, sorry I'm forty eight. Sorry, I forgot that .
So, you're forty eight, and are you able to talk at the moment?
Yeah, yeah.
OK. Tell me, uh, it says here you have a , uh, you're having problems going to the toilet?
Yes, so I have uh, I have um. I don't know how do you say it properly, in English. Uh, I mean without sounding good, like diarrhoea, for, for, yeah. So, it's lasting for like three days. And, uh, yeah, I, I don't know, uh, I don't know, what could cause it. I, uh, um.
OK.
Uh, I have a bit of uh, pain, abdominal pain. And I, had a bit of vomiting.
And uh, uh, yeah. So this uh, kind of like uh, what is happening to me.
OK. Tell me how you were three days ago, before this started.
Did you have any medical problems?
Uh, so I have, I have, I have a, asthma, and I take some uh, some uh, um, inhaler.
OK.
I don't know, uh, I take an inhaler, um. and um. uh, I have an allergy. I have N, N, NK, NKDA allergy. So, I don't know if it's because, uh, I don't know. Could be the inhaler, or, yeah.
OK.
That's .
And apart from asthma, do you have anything else?
Uh, I don't maybe it's work, because you know it's, this thing here in the stomach stuff. I, I always have in the back of my head and my father. Because he died about um, ten years ago of bowel cancer.
Yep.
OK?
So, yeah, this is kind of uh.
Uh, my, my worries. I, I don't know .
OK. So, you've, you've had the diarrhoea for three days, and now you're having pain and vomiting.

Yeah.
Yes, yes, .
Was the diarrhoea been getting better or worse?
Uh, uh, I , I think it, it's not getting better or worse. It's kind of like uh, uh, like, middle, like normal, like uh, it, it, it hasn't gone away, it hasn't worsened.
OK.
OK. And how often do you go to the toilet?
I go, I need to go, I, I can't go to work because I need to go like every. I don't is this feeling like I go to the toilet, and then when I finish, I need to, I feel I need to go again.
OK.
And, and uh, and, yeah. So, I need to be like close to the toilet uh, all the time.
That must be, that must be hard.
Yeah, yeah, it's.
Have you had to drink more water than normal?
I don't know, maybe I'm not drinking enough water, yeah. I drink uh, I think I, yeah I don't know. I, I think I don't drink enough water.
An important question, have you noticed any blood?
Uh, no, I haven't noticed any, any blood.
And you mentioned tummy pain, can you tell me more about your tummy pain, like where it is, and if it goes anywhere?
So, , the pain is mainly uh, focus in, in the centre area of the abdomen, like under the belly, under the belly button. And, uh, yeah, and sometimes I can hear my stomach, uh, like, it comes, uh, yeah.

Yep.
OK. You've been able to eat and drink?
Uh, yes, but, yes but I, I go to the toilet also often. So I, I, I, yeah I try not to eat a lot because I, yeah I just, going to the toilet every, ten minute.
Hmm. And you said the tummy pain's in the middle of your tummy. Does it go anywhere else?
No, no, just there, and it, it seems to be alleviate a bit, toilet, and maybe it's like trapped gas. So, I don't know what it is, but.
OK. And when was the last time you vomited?
I think it was this morning. This morning, I, but the, the thing is like, because I'm not eating anything now. So, I, I haven't vomited again.
Did you have any breakfast?
Right, I don't know.
I didn't. Uh, no sorry, yes I did actually, I did. Pardon, I had some fruit, I had some fruit.

OK. And , and you vomited that up, afterwards?
And afterwards, I didn't have anything, then I got a bit of nausea, and I vomited, and then, uh, yeah and that was it, and that was it. And I have any today, and so now I'm, uh, I think I'm OK, but uh, yeah, and I don't, yeah.
Did you notice any blood when you vomit?
Hmm. I think I do, I think I do, but is uh, uh, no, no actually I can't say sorry, I'm sorry. I, I, I don't think there is blood because uh, yeah it was, it was the strawberries that I was having for breakfast. So, so, yeah, it wasn't blood.

OK. And, um, did you eat anything that you think might of been bad, or anything that could have caused the tummy pain?
Yeah, .
Uh, I, I don't know. To be honest, sometimes I have, when I get a bit of anxiety, I, I use my inhaler. And, but my inhaler kind of um, run out the one. Because you know, I'm a foreigner, so I have uh, this brand, but I bought a new one here.
Yeah.
. OK.
And, uh, I don't know maybe this new one has cause it, this, this problem. I don't know.
OK.
OK. It's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain, like this. Normally, it's when you eat, um, bad food or food that has gone off, and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested. But just to double-check, have you noticed any problems with your breathing?
Mmm.
Uh-huh.
Um, uh, I, I always have problems with my breathing, because of the asthma like, . When I, , I need to use my inhaler a little bit, but apart of the normal, I haven't, I haven't.
OK.
OK. And how about chest, have you noticed any chest pain?
, no, I haven't , I haven't noticed any chest pain.
OK. And how about, um, walking and talking, are those all both OK?
Uh, walking and talking, uh, yes, yes. Uh, I, I, but uh, but yeah I don't walk very far because uh, I, yeah I need to, I need to go to the toilet now and then. So, I'm spending some time at home.
Yep. And when you press on your tummy, does it cause any pain?
Ohh, it does a little bit.
OK.
Sorry, I was just writing some things down.
Sure.
So, what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad, and it's causing your tummy pain. And it's , this is normally called gastroenteritis, so, an infection of the tummy.
OK.
Ohh, OK.
Normally, when patients have this do some things. Number one is to drink lots of water and fluids, because you're losing lots at the moment. Number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers, so, if you start getting a temperature then you need .

Mmm, OK.
Uh-huh.
And please stay home for the time being until you get slightly better.
OK. OK, I, yeah.
And normally,
Normally, things like antibiotics don't help, they make the situation worse.
OK. I didn't, yeah, sorry I didn't. No, I was saying I didn't have any, fever recently. I, I was sweating a little bit the last four days, but I, I. Not sure if, if I had bit of fever, but very, little or, or, I'm, I'm but I don't think so, I don't think. I don't know maybe.
So, that's.
Go ahead.
So, I think that's what we should do for the time being, if you feel you're getting much worse, than I would suggest you go and see your GP in real, in real life, in person, so they can loot at your belly.

OK.
OK, I will, yeah I will book then, book , I will wait a couple of days to see, or one more day, and then I will book, and then, yeah.
Great! Cool! Do you have any more questions for me?
Uh, , no, that's uh, that's it. I was maybe just concerned about my father's uh, medical history, that would uh, I could be at some kind of risk.
Yes.
So, the, the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had, but if your things don't get worse, then that's something that we can look up from the GP.
OK.
OK, OK. Yeah, that sounds good, that sounds good. OK. Thank you very much doctor, for your time. Bye bye.
Does that sound OK?
Thank you .
Bye bye.","**Clinical Note: ICF Framework**

"Hi, there. Good morning!

Uh, I'm Dr. Dean Mesa from Babylon.

Can you hear me OK?
Yep. Can you find
Yeah, OK, great. Well, nice to see you this morning. Um, before we start your appointment, could I confirm your full name and date of birth please?
Uh yeah, uh Jack Smith, uh thirty first October nineteen ninety.
That's perfect, thank you, John. Um, are you in a private place where you're OK to speak at the moment?
I am, yes
OK, great. So, um, tell me what's been going on. You've been saying there's a problem with your hearing. Is that right?
Yeah, so I just feel I can't really hear as well as I used to, like my hearing is kind of deteriorating in some way.
Right, OK. How long has this been going on for?
Uh about six weeks.
Six weeks, OK. Um, and before that have you had any hearing problem at all?
Um I had something maybe, about a year ago, but it only lasted a couple of days, it wasn't anything as long as this.
Right, OK, OK. And, um, in this six week period, have you had anything else happen? Have you had any other ear symptoms at all?
Um, I occasionally get like a ringing in my left ear, uh just on the one side and um there's actually been a few times when I felt kind of a bit sick or a bit dizzy as well.
Right, OK. Uh, uh, um, just to clarify, the difficulty you've got in hearing, is that both ears or just the left ear?
Uh just the left ear, yeah.
Alright, so your right ear is fine.
It seems be yeah.
OK. So you've had ringing, difficulty hearing in your left ear, and feeling slightly sick.
Mh-mm.
Um, that's been, on and off for the six weeks, or is it continuous there throughout that six weeks?
Yeah.
Uh it's kind of on and off. Like some things trigger it as well. So, for example, if I'm watching TV or listen to music or something that'll solve the ringing in the ear.
Right, OK. Um, and, um, have you had any pain from the ear at all?
Uh no my left ear.
OK. Any discharge coming out of the ear? No, OK. Um, have, have you been experiencing any fever?

Uh, not specifically apart from the dizziness so much.
Right, OK. And, um, has your ear been itchy at all?

OK. Now, do you use cotton ball buds to try and clean out wax from your ears?
Uh nah I'll do it.
No, OK. Well, you're right, you should, you shouldn't be doing that. Doesn't clean up wax, it pushes it back in. Alright, um, the first thing that we need to do is we need to get someone to have a look inside your ear.
'K. I'm just exclude the simple things. Simple things might be wax. You know. Someone might have impacted wax, blocking the tube going into the eardrum, which can
OK.
lead to muffled hearing. Um, if that's the case, that that's something that's easy fixable. But, um, so we need to exclude that first.
and then after that, we can consider other potential possibilities. Um, and for that we need to have a look inside the ear drum.
So, um, what I think we could do is, um, maybe if we book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics. It's not an emergency.
It can be done within the next four, five days or so, OK? And then, um, what I'll do, I'll send a message to our admin team.
I'll ask them to slot you into the clinic, one of our clinics in that time frame. You can come in and one of the GPs will just have a quick look in the ear and figure out
whether there's physical blockage or whether there's something else going on, OK? Um, can I just double check, the dizziness that you've been getting, um, how severe is it?
OK.
Yeah.
Uh nothing major it's just kind of uh it's, it's not the kind of dizziness you get with nausea, like uh not, not proper room spinning or anything like that but just, just a little bit kind of off balance.

Right, right, OK. Have, have you had any chest pain with it?

No.
No. Any palpitations, heart beating fast?

OK, fine, alright. Um, so let's get your ear checked out. I think that will be the, the most sensible thing to do. And then after that, we can, we'll be a step closer to figuring out which way we
It might be that there's a problem inside the drum or the balance system within the ear. But, we just need to exclude whether there's
physical blockage first and trying to deal with that if that's the case, OK? Um, but
is that the sort of thing that can cause uh like this uh ringing I've got in my ear, 'cause it seems .
The ringing that you got, that you've got, it's something called Tinnitus. OK? Um
Right.
and Tinnitus is something actually that medicine doctors, we don't really understand it fully. We haven't
OK.
Uh, people can't give you a specific cause for why some patients get Tinnitus and some patients don't. It can be triggered by a wide range of different things, and in fact
I'm glad that you've mentioned that. What I might do, in the time between now and when you come for the appointment, I'm going to, uh, put
paste the link for a leaflet about Tinnitus, um, in the notes for this appointment. I'd really appreciate it if you could start reading about it.
OK.
Sure.
OK. And often that, that, uh, awareness of what it is and what the treatment options are, and there are limited options
um that helps us in terms of conversation about what we do next, if your ear is clear, OK? So, um, I'm going to paste a link to that, um, and you can read about that and
what we'll do is we'll see you in about four, five days time. It won't be with me, it'll be another GP
but they'll have my notes and they'll know exactly what, what my question is, which is just to check your ears. Is that OK?
OK.
Yeah it sounds great.
Alright, great. So, um, bear with me five minutes and then you can ring the support team, I'll leave the number in the notes for this appointment. Ring them, and then they'll slot you in, OK?
OK brilliant.
Alright. If there's any problem, any issues between now and when the clinic appointment is, just book another appointment and you can speak to one of us over video, OK?
OK.
Alright then. Take care. Nice to see you this morning. OK. Bye bye.
Thank you. See you later.","**Clinical Note**

Right, OK.
what that means.
OK, all right. , well it might, it might all be connected then. Um, and um, yesterday, before this, all of this, were you completely fine?
Um, yeah, yeah, kind of, I , I, I can sort of feel my heart beating, but , other than that, no, sort of fine.

OK. So you can feel your heart kind of, um, beating a little bit, bit faster, do you think than normal? Is that?

, I don't know I can just sort of feel it, more , you know. Um, but I've, I've also, I've been feeling a bit, like a bit tired at work.
OK. Sure.
Haven't really been, like exercising has been a bit difficult, because I've been feeling tired.
Um, and, , yeah performing, , performing daily activities has, has been a bit harder than usual.

. OK, all right. , and um, how long has that been for? The tiredness and, you know, , not wanting to exercise and.
Um, , only after, only for a couple of weeks or so.
Couple of weeks, OK. And then, and the last day or so that's when you get the cough and the pain in the side? And you've cough blood, OK, all right. Um, you said you felt a bit warm. , have you measured your temperature at all?
Yep.
Um, with the back of my, my hand, yes.
just with that, OK, fair enough, all right. Um, OK. And now, can I just ask? Um, do you smoke at all?
Uh, no.
OK. What do you work as?
Um, I work in an office, just a, desk job.
OK, all right. And, um, do you live alone?
Uh, yes.

Flat.
OK. Do you have any pets?

A cat, OK. Um, uh, uh, are you on, any medication at all? Regular medication?

Uh, yeah, um, , Methotrexate, Methotrexate, that's.
Methotrexate. OK. , what are you on that for?
Um, I've, I've got SLE.
SLE, OK. Do you have any other , diagnoses? Any other illnesses at all?
No.
Right, OK. Um, and do you have any allergies to any medication?
No.
Any other allergies at all?
No.
OK. So, um, you're on, you're taking Methotrexate at the moment. When was the last time you had Methotrexate?
Uh, this morning.
Ohh, you had it this morning. OK, ohh right, all right.


OK. Um , um, couple of things I'd like to do in order to try and um, get an idea of how, unwell you are.
OK. Um, the first thing I'd like to do, is to try and measure your pulse.
So, what, the way we're gonna do this, is that, if you're, if I can get you to try and locate the pulse in your wrist.
. Not everyone can do this, so don't worry if you can't.
But if you, if you can tell me whether you can feel the regular pulse. It's just under the thumb. If you put two fingers up and down like that, you might be able to feel the pulse.
I've got it.
You got it, OK. Are you sure?
Yep.
All right. So what I'm going to do, is I'm going to tell you when to start counting, and when to stop counting OK. So I'll just get my stopwatch up.
OK. So if you can, um, you've still got the pulse?
Yep.
OK. So if you can start counting, now please.
One, two, three.
Five, six, , eight, , ten, .

If you can stop now, . That, I think that was about eleven or twelve. Um, so that would make your heart rate about, sixty six to seventy four, that's, that's OK, good.
Fantastic. And the next thing I'd like you to try and do, OK. Um, it depends on the lighting, so it may not be possible.
But the next thing I'd like you to try and do is just, to get you to squeeze the tip of your finger.
And then let me see how quickly the redness come back. OK, so if you can see what I'm doing now. My finger's come, right behind the screen, I'm squeezing it, OK. , just watch me first, it's all right, just watch me first. Yeah, I'm, I'm squeezing it.
And then you can see, that, it goes, pale and then it goes back to the normal red colour, OK.
So if I can get you just to put your finger up to the, your camera. And then with the other hand, just try and squeeze it, and see.

You look like you've got very good circulation.

OK, perfect, that's great. Thank you so much.
The last thing I'd like to do, is I'd like , to , try and have a look down your throat.
OK. Are, are you doing this consultation via, um, a phone or a , laptop?
Phone.
A phone?
rested it on my laptop, so I think we're good to go.
, sorry, say that again.
Got it rested the laptop but I can.

OK, , OK. So if you, if you, um, position your device up above your head, put your head back, mouth open wide, and let me see if I can have a . That's, fantastic. And say ah.
Ah.

Perfect. Thank you for that. Excellent.
Lovely.
OK. Last thing, is if I can get you to feel inside your neck. Just on the sides here, OK, um, by your Adam's apple. Tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not.
No, they feel pretty normal to me.
. OK.
I think.
All right. Um.
Now, um, uh, . Sorry, I've forgotten your name.
Um, Doris.

Doris, OK Doris. Um, so, so Doris, um, what, what I think we need to do, is um. This sounds like you might have a chest infection.
OK. If you're coughing up blood, and you're feeling your heart racing. Um.
Uh, I think, you need to be examined today, someone needs to listen to your chest.
And, um, maybe check your blood pressure as well, check that, you're stable. I have to say examining you now, from what limited, examination I could do online.

You're, everything does seem to be OK, in terms of, you, you don't seem acutely unstable.
However, if you've got, this kind of pain, um, when taking a deep breath in and you're coughing up blood. We do, do, we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have a Pneumonia or chest infection.
And um, that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope, and you may need um, an antibiotic. Uh, there's one thing I need to ask you. Have you been, on any long-haul flight recently?

No, no.
No, OK. Have you ever had any clots in your legs, or clots in your lung? Blood clots?
Not that I know of, no.
No, OK. Anyone in the family have that?
No.
No, OK. All right. Um, what I think we'll do is um, we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today.
OK. Um, I would like someone to listen to your chest, and check your blood pressure.
And to, to recheck your pulse as well. Just make sure, and check your temperature, make sure all those parameters are OK.
You may well need an antibiotic, OK. Um, do you have any allergies to any antibiotics?
No.
No, OK. Um, I, I'm not, I'm gonna, not, I'm not going to prescribe anything for you now, because I think you need to have that, basic assessment first.
Um, before we proceed to the next step. But the, that's what I would predict the next step might be. Um, I'm going to leave the number in the notes for this appointment, for you to ring our support team.
And then, they will, book you in for a face-to-face appointment with one of our GPs today.
And then, they'll do that assessment, and then we'll take it from there, OK.
OK.
But we don't think I'm dying of lung cancer.
Um, uh, given the, the way in which you uh, have presented now. Just one day, with a fever and, this slight pain, , concurrent with the, the blood in the, the, the flem.
That's not usually how lung cancer is presented. It's more insidious, over a longer period of time, with other symptoms.
Um, however, we might need to get some investigations to exclude that. It depends on the examination finding, when we see you.
OK.
All right. , are you worried about lung cancer?
Well you know, you start coughing up blood and you think you're, gonna, die of lung cancer, so.
. Sure, of course yeah. So, just remind me how old you are again. I'm sorry.
Forty five.
Forty five, OK. It's something we do need to be cognisant of, OK. Um, and, we may end up having to do a follow-up chest X-ray, if things don't settle down. But at the moment, it, it seems more like a chest infection, rather than a lung cancer.
That's good to know.
Yeah, that, that is good to know, yeah, so that's, 'cause that's easier to treat. But we still need to make sure that things are OK because, chest infections can become nasty as well.
It can lead to infection inside the body, , we want to avoid that as well. So, let's get you checked out today, and hopefully we can put your mind to rest, and get you on the right course of treatment.
Yep.
Perfect. Thank you very much.
All right, you're welcome. All right, take care then. All the best.

"Hi there. It's Doctor Smith from Babylon.
Can you confirm your name, date of birth, and your home address, please?
Um, it's .

. Um, I can't hear you at the moment actually. Could you turn it up, the, volume up?
Uh, can you hear me better now?
. Yeah, that's better. Thank you.
Um, OK. Sorry about that.
Are you in a private place you can have a consultation?
Uh, yes.
What can I do for you today?
Um, I've been having this, blinding headache for a few days. Um, and it's like, really bothering me and , I find it very hard to focus or, like I can't even go to work.
OK, and any headaches in the past before this?
Not really just they're, on and off. Um, I recently had a, a one for like two days, um, but it just went away with Ibuprofen, so nothing like, more, longer than two days before.
So, how did this start?
Um, it just started all of a sudden. I woke up one morning with a headache, and that was three days ago, and I just keep having it.
Doesn't really go away with Ibuprofen either, I try that, but it just. It gets a little bit better but like, doesn't go away.
OK, and whereabouts in your head is the pain?
Um, it's kind of all over but, I feel like over my right eye, it's um bit, stronger.
OK. Any problems with your vision? Or, any problems tolerating the light?
Um, lights definitely make me more sensitive. Like, um, I don't really, like strong lights.
Um, and um, yeah, vision I think, I get this, shooting light sometimes.
Um, not sure how to explain it. Just a bit of um, weird kind of vision.
OK, and um, any, any nausea or vomiting?
Uh, no, feeling a bit sick, but no vomiting.
Any tingling? Or numbness? Or weakness anywhere?
Um, no.
Any change in your smell or taste?
No, none at all.
Um, and, in the past, when you've had headaches, what have they been like?
Um, I was sick but I had no more headache, it's just um, a bit of a pressure, in between my eyes, um.
But nothing major.
OK, and, with, with this, has it been there all the time? Or is it coming and going?
Kinda all the time. Um, so when I take Ibuprofen it gets a bit better, so it's a bit, like less um, it, it bothered me less, but then I still have it, it's still there.
Um, and what would you say, the severity is? If, if ten is the worst pain you've ever had, and zero is nothing, what would you say the pain is like?
I guess it's mostly, eight, and then it kinda comes down to maybe a five.
OK, and what about at night-time, are you able to fall asleep?
Um, yeah, I'm, sleeping well.
Is it waking you up in the night-time?
No, no, no. But I can wake up with it in the morning.
OK. Any worse when you change position, or bend over, or cough, or anything like that?
Mmm.
Sometimes when I stand up, quickly I get a bit of a, stabbing pain. Um, or if I throw my head like, it I kind of feel like something is moving inside.
OK. And have you had any, uh, eye checks recently?
Um, yeah, actually had one recently and, nothing changed my vision.
OK. And have you had any cold symptoms, sore throat, sore ears, or pain over the sinuses? Any cough or flem?
No, no.

No. Any, any nose bleeds, or coughing up any blood or anything?
No.
And just recently, have you been well, or have you had any general problems? Any change in your weight? Or, tiredness, lack of energy, anything like that?
Um, no change of weight, maybe um, lack of energy but it might be because, I'm just having these headaches. so I'm find it quite difficult to go through my daily activities , you know when you have this constant headache.

Have you been at work recently?
Um, I work from home but, couldn't really manage to, do it all the time. So sometimes I just took a day off.
So, you've been, you've had a headache for three days. , how many days have you missed off work?
Um, so I worked from home all these three days and, um. First day I worked from home and then, um, the second I just took the whole day off. And, today I just tried to work from home the first half of the day but, I, I just stopped in the morning 'cause, I couldn't focus.
OK. And, any other, medical problems in the past?
Um, I think I only had a, a pain, um, when I was younger but, no causes found and that went away, but that's, the only thing I know of.

OK. Have you been abroad recently at all?
No.
Do you take any medications?
Um, just the pill.
Which one?
Um, .
And when did you start that?
Um, about a year ago.
Any side effects with that?
Uh, no I don't think so.
Have you noticed any, any um, increased frequency of headaches since you started that?
Um, no, , these headaches just very recently, but nothing um, but nothing really changes.

OK. And when you'd , when you've had, when you described your headaches in the past, you said they were just general. Did you have any visual symptoms? Flashing lights? Nausea, vomiting with them?
No.
No, no.
No nothing, none of those.
Have you had your blood pressure checked recently with your pill?
Um, yeah, I had it checked in the pharmacy when I got the pill, and they say it was normal.
And when was that?
Uh, a year ago.
OK. Um, and any allergies to anything?
No.
And who do you live with at home?
Sorry?
Who do you live with at home?
Uh, just by myself.
OK. And do you smoke?
Uh, no.
Do you drink any alcohol regularly?
Yeah.
How much in a normal week do you think?
Um, probably like, three , once a week.
. OK. And do you take any other drugs at all?
Um, no apart from the Ibuprofen that I take, sometimes when, the headache gets really bad, nothing else.
OK.
Um. So, uh, I mean it's obviously the first time you've had such a bad headache. And you said you'd had some altered light in front of your eyes as well?
Yeah.
But you haven't had a high temperature. Have you checked your temperature?
Uh, no I didn't, I don't really feel, feverish or anything.
OK. Um, I mean it, it, it could possibly be a migraine type headache.
But, the fact it's still ongoing for three days, we probably should, book you into an appointment to get an examination.

Um, obviously , if it settles, in the meantime then, we can cancel that. But we should do a neurological examination, look at the back of your eyes as well.
OK.
Um, in terms of medication, I can prescribe you something, similar to Ibuprofen, but a bit stronger which you can take instead of Ibuprofen. And you can also take Paracetamol at the same time.

OK.
So if you're happy to book a, , appointment with us, with the support line, for us to do a full examination.
And start, the medication which I prescribe to you, take it with food.
If, if you're, you said that when you go to bed your headache's, OK, and not waking you up in the night-time.
Yeah it's not, um but, you mentioned migraine and that um, reminded that, my mum, suffers from, like she has migraines, um.
OK. Any other family history of medical problems?
Um, no I think that's it, but I know that my mum like, she has quite bad migraines, she's like, has the vomiting and everything, .
OK that's fine. Um, I mean if, if in the meantime before your appointment your, headache is getting unbearable, getting worse or changing. Then , um, if it's that bad, then you should go to A and E and have an examination.
Um, , you can call us for further advice on that.
OK.
Mm-hmm, OK.
And when, when you have a, an examination with us, we'll check your blood pressure as well.
Just to, make sure your pill's still appropriate for you, because sometimes if we, if we do think it's a migraine, then you would have to change your pill. If you've had these flashing lights, and things like that.

OK, .
Is there anything in the pill that can cause it? Or is it?
Well , some , so that pill if you were having , regular migraines with um, flashing lights, or , other symptoms. It wouldn't be suitable to stay on that pill, particularly, we'd have to change it to something else.
All right.
But you can carry on with that for the moment.
OK.
Have you got any other questions?
Um, so will you like, um, send me a referral to a specialist, or do I have to to confirm?
Uh.
Yeah, if you book an appointment with the support team, then we can do a full examination then.
OK. Perfect.
All right then. Take care.
Thank you very much.

Um, other than that, it's, it's OK, yeah.
And have you lost any weight?
I have, a little bit, yes. Uh, but, uh, but that's, that's
Over, over long period now.
OK, right. So you mentioned that you've lost your appetite for a while now. So how long are we talking about?
It must have started when I
When I changed over to the new law firm. Uh, I would say months ago.
We talking about two months, three months, or six months ?
Uh, uh.
Three months ago, three and a half months ago, that was.
and a half months ago. But you said your weight loss is much longer than that?
Yeah it stopped doing that, uh, yeah.
Sorry, could you , I couldn't hear you. What did you say, your weight loss, how long?
It started a little bit earlier than that. I, I, I'm not sure, though, how it's gonna
at least six months, would you say?
Uh.
Something like that, yeah.
six months. And roughly how much have you lost? Just approximately.
Ohh gosh. I would say, less than a storm, something like that.
So about a stone, yeah? Six months, OK. OK. , OK.
Right, OK. So, just a few more questions. It might seem a bit awkward, but it's quite relevant. OK? So, how are your bowels? Are they OK?


Um, I feel nauseous every now and again. Uh, it, it's, it's coming up, uh, yeah, it's just every now and again not feeling very good. Uh, trying to eat something, but don't really want to.

Yeah, um, your bowels. How's your toilet?
Uh.
That's OK, I would say. Uh, I don't really have problems when going to the toilet, it's just painless.

Uh, no. No diarrhoea. No,no .
OK, so there's blood in the poo no mucus nothing of that sort?
Uh.
Uh, no, no, nothing.
Just now, you mentioned nausea. Have you been ever sick with it?
No, actually not. Uh, . Yeah I'm feeling not well, uh, in the, in the, in the bowel region, yeah.

OK, well just the nausea, OK. Is there any particular foods that make you nauseous?
Nauseous.
No, nothing.
OK. So you can't think of any real.... Do you suffer from acid reflux?
I do not, no.
OK, OK. You also mentioned that you're feeling short of breath so yeah is there any cough?

Um, no, not really just, just
OK.
It's like when, when when I go into the lift, uh, it, it happens to be that, uh, I like, you know, my heart starts beating and I can't really breath, uh
Yeah. Is it like in closed spaces?

No, it happens every time. It happens very significantly in, in the lift or when I'm, when I'm
So, how far can you walk and when you start feeling short of breath? So how far can you walk with no shortness of breath?
Um.
Walk or run.
Walk, you start with walk. Do you feel short of breathlet's start this way, do you feel short of uh breath when you walk at all?
No, actually not.
Right. You so you can walk about a mile and you don't feel short of breath at all.
That's right, yes.
OK, so just explain a bit more just make myself clear about the lift thing. So you said you're short of breath when you're in the lift?
Yeah, my heart starts beating. I, I feel like I can't breathe and, and, uh, it's, it's very difficult too.
Uh yeah, two twenty nine. Uh, it's going, yeah just, just that you, you know, when, when you just feel unwell, and yeah, your heart starts beating.
described them like palpitations to me, yeah? So that's what you're, you're feeling your own heartbeat.
Yep
Yeah, OK. You get any chest pains with it?
Not really, no. It's just that
OK.
OK, no chest pains.
I'm up.
No chest pain.
OK. Alright. Fine. So, what we need to do, um, just before that, um, just a few more things. Uh, any any past medical history you'd like to share with me today?
Uh, yes. I had too little activity of my thyroid, uh.
Sorry you had thyroid problems.
Thyroid. Too little activity, yes.
Ohh yeah, underactive thyroid, yes. Yep.
Um, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, and in, in
In view of that, I took thyroxine.
Yeah, you're taking thyroxine? Are you using it every day?

Uh, not anymore.
Why is that?
Uh, I have, I have not been taking it in the last, actually since I changed doctor, I would say.
OK, so is that, so all these things are since you've stopped taking the thyroxine?
Ohh.
That might be coinciding, I'm not sure about that.
When was your last blood test?
Uh, haven't taken one in a long time.
OK, so you've not had a blood test.
Mm hmm
Right, OK. It could, you know, generally for you know for underactive thyroids what symptoms you've said um it's the opposite that usually happens, yeah. It's for overactive thyroid like you can feel a bit like the racing of your heart beat and all so I'm not quite clear on what picture we are having here. Yeah?
OK.
I think a general set of bloods is a good , good start. So what we look at, because you're not, you're not having the umph, aren't you? You're like, you're just feeling a bit, you know low and things like that, right? Well, um, and weak and things like that. So we'll just do a general set of bloods. we look at things like anaemia, how your kidney functions are, your livers, all that, with vitamin levels, and your .
OK.
yes.
No problem.
OK. And uh, now after we get those set of bloods, we will find out if we can find anything in them. If that's all clear, then we would need to do a physical examination. OK?
Uh huh
Okay.
We would need to then go in and do . But there's nothing from what your history you've said that, that we urgently warrant a physical examination at this point in time. I think it's a good idea to start off with a blood test, and then take it from there.
OK.
Obviously with palpitations or chest pain, if you get that's more of a medical emergency. You need to go to A and E for that. OK? If things change, you've mentioned now your bowels are fine, and you're not being sick. So if that's the case it's OK, but if your, you know, bowels change or you're being sick again, you need to get in touch with us. OK?
OK, I have, I haven't been walking lately at all. I haven't, yes. I haven't been walking lately at all so like, it's really hard for me to identify when I feel the shortness of breath.
Sorry? Could you repeat that?
Mm-hmm.
Uh, just wanted to add that into , because, um, I haven't been walking. I haven't been feeling good enough for a good at all. So, yep.
OK. So let's do all the blood tests first and we'll take it from there. OK? But you know, if you have any chest pains, or change in bowel habits, do get in touch with us.
Thank you.

I will, yes.
OK. Now what we need to do is now you need to ring up support. And I'll the form for you, but in the interim you need to call support so that we can organise that blood test for you. And when you get the result, you will receive a text message through your phone to tell you to book an appointment. If you're feeling poorly, don't wait for that. Just get in touch with us again, yeah?
Uh huh.

OK. Can I
I will. How do I call to report?
Ohh, there's a number on your app, yeah? If you open up your app there's the number on there. It's an oh three hundred number, yeah? So just call that number.
OK.
I will find it, thank you.
Alright then. You take care. Bye now.
Thank you, ciao.

OK. Uh, righty-ho. So, you've mentioned you've, got a history of eczema, so what do you do about it? How do you keep it under control?
Yeah, usually I use a a a cream called diprobase. Uh, and in the shower I use something called dermal.

Dermal, alright, and have you been using them recently, or not?
Yes. Yes, I, I use them.
You use them every day?
Yes I, there there's no change in that. I didn't change any .

OK. Have you ever used steroids in the past, for your eczema?
Um.
I, I, I'm not sure. Uh, ah, yes, yes, yes, I remember now, I

You've used steroids before?
Um, but it, it's not helping.

Yeah. Also, you're still using the steroids.
Yeah, I tried. I tried.
Which one are you using, the steroids? What's the name?
I'm not sure, it's uh, I would have the box is not there.
, is it the ?
OK. So, is it like the over-the-counter ones?
Sorry?
Over the counter Hydrocortisone. That, does that ring a ? Yeah. So you're using the Hydrocortisone, yeah?
Yes.
Are you using any antihistamines at all?
I
No.
No, no antihistamines. OK.
Right, fine. Otherwise, other than those rash, you're feeling well in yourself. There's no temperature, no joint pains, yeah? No fever?
But, I remember that I've tried and it didn't work.
You've tried the antihistamines and it didn't work. OK which one did you try?
The one over-the-counter.
OK, so like cetirizine, yeah?
Yeah, OK, that's fine. Right. OK, so from what you're describing,
It looks like, you know, it is quite widespread, your eczema.
Yeah? 'Cause you're having it all over your chest and hands and things like that. Um. So do you have any allergies to any medication at all?
Mm-hmm.
No, no allergies.
No allergies, OK. And you don't, other than eczema you don't have any other medical condition.
I, I have asthma, and, uh, in my family, uh, there's hypothyroidism and migraine. My mother has migraine.
Mother has migraine and, what was the other one, I didn't understand.
hypothyroidism.
who who has hypothroidism?
My mother.
OK. So, she has hyperthyroidism. OK. That's fine. Right here, you mentioned you have asthma. So, what medications are you using for asthma?
Um uh, you know, probably neither. Uh
The blue inhaler? So you don't, you don't use it everyday, so you just use it on and off, yeah?
Yeah. Yeah.
Blue inhalers. But your breathing's all OK, yeah?
OK, yeah, yeah. It's only when I have a flare.
Yeah.
Sure. So, what we need to do is, obviously, you've got , as I've mentioned. So, extensive eczema.
What we'll do, we need a couple of minutes. Because to keep your a bit comfortable, we'll, you would probably need some antihistamines, which I'm going to prescribe.
Also, hydrocortisone is a baby steroid that you use for young children. You might probably need a bit more stronger one, like betnovateor something like that. OK?

So we'll try that first. So I'm going to it's called the antihistamine is called Fexofenadine. And then we'll try with some Betnovate first. So it's like very small amount, like it's like one fingertip.
Yeah. This much is, is enough to cover your palms.
And your - back of your hands, yeah? So it's very small amounts, so that if you can imagine you can cover with a very small amount the whole body.
Yeah. So use that. You, you have to use it twice a day, for the next couple of weeks.
OK. If, if there's no improvement, you need to get back to us. Or, if you have any kind of adverse reaction, like an allergic reaction, which is unlikely, but if it still happens you need to get in touch with us. OK?
OK.
OK. Thank you very much.
So, what we're going to do is, we're going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy. It looks like Boots on the systems, is that correct?
Yeah? Yes, so i'll send it across to Boot's. And it will be there for collecting.
Yes.
If things are getting worse in the next two weeks, call us before hand. Otherwise, wait for two weeks, take the medication and the cream.
You still need to continue on your, emollients like the dermal soap, and, as well as the, diprovate. Yeah, so you still need to use those, in the interim. Any questions at all?

No. No questions. Thank you. Thank you very
OK then. You take care then. Bye bye now.
OK.

[doctor] yeah if i remember right your family do n't they own that that bakery down on the corner of main street and did n't they own that
[patient] yeah thank you

[doctor] okay
[patient] but i mean you know they they you know i have to visit them and you know i end up you know i mean getting some stuff but it's not that much
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it's been i try to contain it you know
[doctor] well let me so we're gon na have to watch that and i'll come back and we'll talk a little bit about the diabetes but let's go ahead and do that i do n't wan na do a a a quick physical exam on you i'm gon na look in your eyes here and so let me quickly look in your ears
[patient] i see
[doctor] okay that looks good and any let me let me listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and your heart it's a regular rate and rhythm that's all good as we go through that now i want you to sit up here i'm gon na press down your back starting at the top and any pain up top no
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and then once i get down here and around that low back i wan na press in the center first does that cause you a lot of pain

[doctor] lay back on the stretcher for me for a second i'm gon na go ahead and and lift your legs for me or i'm gon na go ahead and lift your legs for you just relax i'm gon na start here on the right side when i lift that right leg up does that cause you significant pain or any pain at all
[patient] a little a little bit
[doctor] okay let me come around let me lift up the left side if i lift that up does that cause
[patient] yeah yeah yeah that's that's
[doctor] yeah
[patient] still get tender yeah
[doctor] i can see that gritts on your face so okay that's good and you know as i look at your lower extremities there is no pain or numbness or tingling in your feet or anything like that
[patient] hmmm no
[doctor] okay okay so lem me talk a little bit about my impression and plan so for that low back pain i believe you have a musculoskeletal low back strain i'm going to order a low back x-ray so we'll order that and get that done as an outpatient i do n't expect to see anything significant but it's gon na tell me how those joint spaces look and if you know if we're dealing with any disk issue but that will be the start of it and i'm also gon na order some physical therapy two for two reasons to help with a little bit with the pain but also strengthen some of the muscles there in the back so those are the two things that we are gon na do now i want you to take take four hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that occasionally with some tylenol when the pain gets more severe up to about three times a day i'm gon na also give you a prescription for some flexeril that's a muscle relaxant and i want you to take one of those once a day every evening but be careful if you're doing any strenuous or hazardous activities such as driving after you take those now for your diabetes my impression is that your diabetes is is under control i noticed that we do n't have n't had a a1c for almost five months so i'm also gon na order an a1c so we can find out where we are with that continue with your diet and exercise we know that's really important and then continue with your metformin i'm not gon na make any changes today but we'll go ahead and look at that once i get that results of that a1c do you have any questions for me
[patient] yeah can i still go to the bakery
[doctor] i would yes it's nice for you to go to the bakery but you ca n't have any donuts i'm no i you just really need to watch that intake of of anything that you might get at the at the bakery so just just be careful with those carbohydrates those sweets that you're taking as we go through your day it's occasional occasional one perfectly fine but on a routine basis we need to watch that
[patient] right and how soon should i you know check my blood sugars i mean what's a good you know
[doctor] yeah i that's a great question i'm really glad you asked that i would prefer that you're taking your blood pressure every morning the first thing you get up when you get up in the morning that's gon na give me a good idea and so if you can do that the first thing in the morning and keep a record of it you know i know your glucometer keeps a record of it but if you can write them down and once we get that a1c that's gon na give me a little more guidance on how to deal with your blood your diabetes
[patient] right do you think would i need to see you know a pain doctor or you know
[doctor] not yet let's let's get the that's a great question i may end up referring you to a a pain doctor for that low back pain but i really would like to start with some of the diagnostics first let's get an x-ray and if there is you know any question of that x-ray and the pain continues i'm gon na go ahead and maybe order a cat scan and then at that point in time we can refer you to a pain doctor if we're still having significant pain
[patient] sounds good
[doctor] okay thank you i'm gon na send my nursing to see you and we'll get you out the door
[patient] thank you
[doctor] take care
[patient] that one is a follow-up mm-hmm","Noah presented today with a one-week history of low back pain, initially triggered by a twisting motion while lifting an object. The pain began as transient but recurred after several hours, persisting since. It is localized to the lower mid-back, with intermittent radiation to the left side, exacerbated by sudden left-sided movements. No neurological deficits (numbness, tingling) or radiating pain to extremities were noted.  

Past medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus, managed with metformin 500 mg twice daily. The patient reports adherence to medications but acknowledges occasional lapses in blood sugar monitoring. Morning glucose readings have trended higher, with no recent A1C. Dietary management includes limited carbohydrate intake, though the patient admits to occasional visits to a local bakery, consuming small amounts of sweets.  

Physical examination revealed tenderness to palpation in the lower lumbar region, particularly at the midline and left paraspinal areas. Mild discomfort was noted with passive left leg elevation, but no pain or neurological abnormalities in the lower extremities. Lungs and heart were clear, with regular rate and rhythm.  

Plan:  
- **Imaging**: Low back X-ray to assess for musculoskeletal strain or structural abnormalities.  
- **Therapy**: Referral for physical therapy to address pain and strengthen lumbar musculature.  
- **Medications**:  
  - Ibuprofen 400 mg PRN for pain, up to three times daily.  
  - Acetaminophen for breakthrough pain.  
  - Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) 10 mg nightly for muscle relaxation.  
- **Diabetes Management**:  
  - Order A1C to evaluate glycemic control.  
  - Reinforce morning fasting glucose monitoring (first thing upon waking) and record values.  
  - Dietary counseling to limit bakery visits and carbohydrate intake; occasional treats are permitted but should not be routine.  
- **Follow-up**: Re-evaluate in 1 week for X-ray results and adjust plan as needed. Consider referral to pain management if symptoms persist despite conservative measures.  

No immediate interventions required. Patient advised to avoid strenuous activities and report worsening pain or new neurological symptoms.","Noah presents with low back pain of one week duration, initially triggered by a twisting motion while lifting an object.

[doctor] okay when did you first notice this
[patient] i wan na say it's been a while but probably worsening in the past like six months or so
[doctor] okay okay and have you seen ever noticed any rashes either when it first started or intermittently anywhere else
[patient] on my body no not really
[doctor] okay okay just mainly up underneath your on your scalp there uh and i can i can see that man that looks really itchy and scaly have you died your hair recently or used any other chemicals you you know like a new hair spray or gel
[patient] nothing new i mean i do dye my hair but i've been doing that for years now but otherwise i do n't really use a lot of products in my hair
[doctor] yeah i you know it's funny you say that because i keep saying i earned this gray hair and i'm gon na keep it so yeah have you tried any over the counter treatments i know there is a lot out of there something you know like a t gel or any of those other have those helped
[patient] yeah i did that i did head and shoulders i even tried some castor oil and but none of them really seemed to be helping
[doctor] okay okay let's talk about some other symptoms any joint pain fever weight loss
[patient] not that i can recall i've been pretty good otherwise
[doctor] okay good and going back you know to your grandparents has anybody else in the family had similar symptoms that you're aware of
[patient] no well maybe my sister
[doctor] maybe your sister okay
[patient] yeah maybe my sister i mean i know she'll is no one has as bad as i do but she does report like just having a dry scalp
[doctor] okay okay now you know a lot of times we can see this with you know high levels of stress has there been any new mental or emotional stressors at work or at home

Just, yeah, peeing quite frequently, but it's all seeming normal. Yeah, I probably wouldn't have, thought of, it being, linked but, yeah.
OK.
All right so you're. Um, so the main symptom is feeling sick, uh with this. Uh, and you've been feeling bunged up, and this this sort of, pain in your tummy.
Just to ask a few more question about the pain in your tummy. Is it, how would you describe the pain?
Um, it's.
Yeah, it's like below my belly button. Um, it's, it's aching. Um, it does make me feel nauseous. Um.
Yeah, so it's kinda more like a, I guess like an, an, a, a dull ache. Um, just below the belly button, kind of, yeah, here.
Um, and it's, it, is it constant? Or is it coming and going?
Um, it's, yeah it's, feeling pretty constant, over the last couple of day.
It.
Um, and just need to ask a few questions about, uh, your periods and stuff. Uh, any chance you could be pregnant at the moment?
Um.
Ooh, I don't know.

Um, probably not, I don't think so. I'm very careful.
sexually active at the moment?
Yes, yeah.
And, um, .
You mentioned about periods. I did notice a bit of, um.
I don't know it's like , not necessarily like spotting, but in like, in my, my pee is like a little, I suppose. I think I thought it was my period, it's like a little bit, pink.
In your pee, did you say? Your, so your pee is slightly red? Or slightly pink?

But I am kind of like due, on my, didn't know if that was like, yeah, a part of it.
OK. So, when was your last menstrual period?
Um, around a month ago, yeah, three and a, three and a bit weeks ago.
Ah, OK. Um, so it's three .
And, uh, did you say? So you're sexually active, you're using contraception? And what?
Mm-hmm, yeah. I've got the arm, the implants.
Um.
And.
Uh, , one sexual partner? Um, a regular, regular boyfriend or?
Yeah.
Yep.
Um.
, to go back to your symptom of, uh, constipation. Can I just clarify, when was the last time you had a bowel motion?
Uh, yesterday.
OK, and, uh, do you feel like, you, are still quite bunged up at the moment?
Uh, no it seems to have cleared up. So I was, about a week ago, but I'm OK, OK now, the last few days.
Yeah, I K.
OK, all right. So you, just to sort of confirm your symptoms. Um, you're feeling sort of sick, nauseous, with tummy pain, which is fairly constant.
Um, how, , did the tummy pain come on suddenly or gradually?
Um, it's only been for the last two days. Um, so I guess yeah, quite recently.
OK.
So it's, it's come on gradually, has it?
Yeah.
Not a sudden onset?
OK, and uh, your last menstrual period was just three and a bit weeks ago. Um, and you, but you say you've had some . A little bit of spotting, possibly before um, in-between periods, or recently.
Yeah, and the last kind of week or so, yeah, the last couple of days really.
But, because I was due on.
Yeah, I, I think. Yeah, just the last couple of days.
OK, and, but you're expecting your period soon?
Yes, yeah.
Sure. Um. OK, and just to ask a few questions. Are you, uh, do you have any other medical, uh, problems? Um, that I need to be aware of?
Uh.
Don't .
I'm um, allergic to Amoxicillin.
Allergic to Amoxicillin. Um, but no other medical problems, that you?
No, not that I'm aware of.
Any drug allergies? Ohh, you mentioned Amoxicillin, but anything else?
No, that's it.
Um, and, do you take any medications at the moment?
Um, no, no medications, but I'm on the implants. I think it's called um, Implanon.
Implanon, yeah sure. OK. Uh, do you smoke?
Or something.
No.
OK, and uh, do you live with, uh, alone? With your partner?
With my boyfriend.
With your boyfriend. And, um, any other medical, uh sorry, any, uh, diseases run in your, run in your family?
Um.
Not any that.
Spring to mind in my immediate family. Um, my brother is a type one diabetic.
Sure.

great so, um, is there anything that you're particularly concerned about with, um, this nausea, and uh, the constipation?
Um, I don't know it just a really, like really horrible ache. Um.
And I'm nauseous, hot, sweaty, feeling, I'm not really sure.
Mmm.
I, yeah, why it's happening, um. the last couple of days, that's probably all that's.
yeah.
Any.
Yeah, it's getting uncomfortable.
Yeah. Anything that you'd hoped, particularly, to get out of having this consultation?
Anything , sorry?
was there anything that you'd hoped to, get out of having this specific consultation? Other than a diagnosis, and getting better, and, you know, being on the right track to, to, feeling better?
Yeah, I know that's kind of, I just wanna, um, get back .
Get to normal, yeah.
but a bit more .
Yeah, sure, sure. OK, um, so, and then finally. I, I didn't ask you, do you have any discharge, or anything like that, from down below?
Uh, no, no, no discharge.
No discharge. OK.
All right. So, um, I , I, I think, uh.
This could be a few different things. It could just be simple constipation. Uh, you mentioned that you were bunged up, but you did go yesterday. So it's, um, and your, your bowel habits, that you've been going regularly.
Uh, but you did mention that you were bunged up. Um, but there could be a few other things going on.
I would quite like to, uh, see you to do some further, to do an examination, and to do some, some tests as well.
Um, we need to definitely rule out pregnancy, with you. And possibly, um, do some other examinations or, or further tests. So, would you be happy to actually see a GP face-to-face, um, soon?
Today, ideally.

Yes, yeah.
Yeah?
Sure, I can make time.
Are you, and you're feeling hot, hot and, sweaty. Have you been feeling, um, light-headed at all? Or like you're going to faint?

No, no, not like I'm gonna faint.
OK. Right well, we're just sort of, timing out, running out of time a little bit. But, um, I'd really like to see you, uh, for some more, uh, examination, investigations.
If in the meantime um, between now and, and me, sort or a GP seeing you, you feel worse in any way, you get light-headed.
Um, you, uh, uh you have, you develop any symptoms which are concerning to you. Um, then I think you should take them quite seriously, and, and see somebody more urgently if possible.
Um, OK. Is that, uh, , was there anything else that you wanna talk about right now? I'm glad we got the ball rolling with this, and uh, we can , um, sort of see you again, to take this a little bit further.
Mm-hmm.
OK.
Yeah, thank you, really appreciate that.
OK.
All right. Thanks for your time.

OK.
cheers, bye.
Thanks, bye.","**Clinical Note**

[patient] it hurts like in , in , in the inside of my knee .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] right here .
[doctor] all right . and anything make it better or worse ?
[patient] i have been putting ice on it , uh , and i've been taking ibuprofen , but it does n't seem to help much .
[doctor] okay . so it sounds like you fell a couple days ago , and you've hurt something inside of your right knee .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] and you've been taking a little bit of ice , uh , putting some ice on it , and has n't really helped and some ibuprofen . is that right ?
[patient] that's right . yeah .
[doctor] okay , let's review your past history for a second . it looks like , uh , do you have any other past medical history ?
[patient] uh , afib .
[doctor] okay , and are you taking any medications for that ?
[patient] yeah , i am . um , begins with a d.
[doctor] uh , digoxin ?
[patient] that's it . yeah , that's it .
[doctor] okay , all right . how about any surgeries in the past ?
[patient] i have had a nose job .
[doctor] all right . um , let's do your exam , okay ? so is it tender ... where is it mostly tender right now ?
[patient] right on the inside of my knee . right here .
[doctor] all right , so if i bend your knee forward , does that seem to hurt ?
[patient] yes , that hurts .
[doctor] all right , how about if i twist it a little bit that way .
[patient] that hurts a lot .
[doctor] okay , okay . and how about down here ? do you feel me touch you down here ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . any other pain down here in your calves ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] no , okay . so on exam you do have some tenderness over the medial portion of your knee over the medial meniscus area . uh , there is no , uh , there is a little bit of tenderness when i flex your , uh , when i , uh , uh , do some valgus stressing on your , on your leg . um , you have normal sensation . so let's take a look at your x-rays .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay . hey dragon , show me the x-rays . so looking at the x-ray , um , of your left knee , uh , it appears to be there's no fractures there right now . i do n't see any , uh , there's a little bit of , uh , fluid , uh , but there is no , uh , there's no , um , fracture or there's no dislocation . everything else seems to be lined up properly , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so in summary after my exam , uh , looking at your knee , uh , on the x-ray and your exam , you have some tenderness over the medial meniscus , so i think you have probably an acute medial meniscus sprain right now or strain . uh , at this point , my recommendation would be to put you in a knee brace , uh , and we'll go ahead and have you use some crutches temporarily for the next couple days . we'll have you come back in about a week and see how you're doing , and if it's not better , we'll get an mri at that time .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i'm going to recommend we give you some motrin , 800 milligrams . uh , you can take it about every six hours , uh , with food . uh , and we'll give you about a two week supply .

**Behavior**  
Ms. Thompson, a 43-year-old female, presented with acute right knee pain following a fall from a ladder while attempting to change a light bulb. She twisted her knee during the fall and has experienced persistent pain localized to the medial compartment of the knee, with tenderness over the medial meniscus area. She reported no other injuries. Pain is exacerbated by knee flexion and valgus stress, with minimal improvement from ice and ibuprofen (400 mg daily). She has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) managed with digoxin and a prior rhinoplasty.  

**Intervention**  
- **Physical Examination**: Tenderness noted over the medial meniscus; pain with passive flexion and valgus stress. No calf pain or neurological deficits.  
- **Imaging**: X-rays of the right knee revealed no fractures, dislocations, or significant joint space narrowing, though mild joint effusion was present.  
- **Diagnostic Assessment**: Suspected acute medial meniscus sprain/strain based on mechanism of injury, localized tenderness, and imaging findings.  

**Response**  
- Patient confirmed pain localized to the medial knee, with no improvement from self-care measures.  
- Examination and imaging findings supported a diagnosis of medial meniscus injury without bony abnormalities.  

**Plan**  
- **Acute Management**:  
  - Prescribe **Motrin 800 mg** orally every 6 hours as needed for pain, with food, for a 2-week supply.  
  - Recommend **knee brace** for stability and **crutches** to avoid weight-bearing.  
- **Follow-Up**:  
  - Return in 7 days for reassessment; if symptoms persist or worsen, proceed with **MRI** of the right knee.  
- **Medications**:  
  - Continue digoxin for AFib.  
  - Advise patient to discontinue ibuprofen and use Motrin as prescribed.  
- **Activity Modification**: Avoid strenuous activities; monitor for worsening pain, swelling, or neurological changes.

[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] if i bend it this way up does it hurt it's your left does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] how about this
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so pain with both flexion and extension

[doctor] looks like you have little bit of limited range of motion on extension not on flexion though you said it hurts right here on the inside of your elbow
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so pain on the medial side with palpation
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright how about the outside
[patient] no
[doctor] no pain with palpation outside of the elbow you have do you have normal sensation in your fingers
[patient] i think so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay great
[patient] good to go
[doctor] sensation is normal to the touch
[patient] yes
[doctor] pulses equal in all extremities how about the left elbow same thing if i bend it this way does that hurt
[patient] not as much
[doctor] how about this way
[patient] not as much
[doctor] alright so little bit of pain on flexion and extension little bit of limited range of motion on extension of the arm how about if you twist like you're opening a door
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so some pain with torsion and twisting supination what about pronation
[patient] no
[doctor] no pain with pronation on the right side
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] same thing on the left
[patient] yes
[doctor] pain with supination no pain with pronation
[patient] correct
[doctor] alright so dylan it took some x-rays coming in looks like you do n't have any any fractures or any bony misalignment which i expect with this kind of injury i do think that what you have is medial epicondylitis which is
[patient] is that golfer's elbow
[doctor] yes same thing have you been golfing a lot
[patient] well not in the past year and a half i've had this for a long time
[doctor] okay also known as pictures elbow
[patient] well i have n't been pitching either
[doctor] hmmm well in any case what i'm gon na have to do is i'm gon na send you up for mri to take another look at this
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] that will be our next step so we'll get you scheduled for the mri probably get you in pretty quick here since we're a private practice
[patient] thank god
[doctor] yeah and once you get the mri i'll know a little bit more what i'd like to do is something called a whole blood transfusion have you heard of that before
[patient] no please tell me remind me
[doctor] yeah it should help with the healing of your elbow it's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow
[patient] you do a stick needle in my elbow
[doctor] mm-hmm and help with some of the healing of your elbow
[patient] so it's kinda like dry needling then
[doctor] no
[patient] not at all
[doctor] what is it
[patient] is it is that that thing where like you take the blood out of like say my my thigh
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then you literally inject it into my tendon
[doctor] yes
[patient] that it activates the healing
[doctor] yeah that's exactly what it is
[patient] interesting cool
[doctor] yeah
[patient] maybe i have heard about that
[doctor] we've we've had some really good responses from other patients on it so hopefully i mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this
[patient] i'm excited
[doctor] yeah and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks it's not not a major procedure and you should heal in the next two weeks so that wo n't be a problem especially considering that you're expecting a newborn soon we want to make sure you're all healed for that
[patient] wow i did n't even say that
[doctor] i read it in your chart
[patient] man you doctors are good

**Situation**:  
Patient Dylan presents with bilateral elbow pain, predominantly on the right elbow, exacerbated by arm use and supination. Pain began approximately 1.5 years ago, persists despite ibuprofen (800 mg TID), and is unresponsive to icing.  

**Background**:  
- **Activity**: Weightlifting enthusiast with heavy lifting regimen.  
- **History**: No prior elbow injuries or sports-related trauma (basketball, baseball, football in youth).  
- **Symptoms**:  
  - Bilateral medial elbow pain, worsening with arm activity.  
  - Limited range of motion on right elbow extension; pain with flexion and extension.  
  - Medial elbow tenderness on palpation; no pain on lateral side.  
  - Pain with supination; no pain with pronation.  
- **Imaging**: X-rays show no fractures or bony misalignment.  

**Assessment**:  
- **Diagnosis**: Medial epicondylitis (golfer’s elbow) based on clinical findings.  
- **Differential Considerations**: Excluded fractures, bony abnormalities.  

**Recommendation**:  
1. **MRI**: Schedule for further evaluation of soft tissue involvement.  
2. **Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Injection**: Consider as a potential treatment to promote healing, pending MRI results.  
3. **Activity Modification**: Advise avoidance of heavy lifting and repetitive arm motions until further evaluation.  
4. **Pregnancy Consideration**: Patient is expecting a newborn; ensure full recovery before delivery to minimize risk of complications.  
5. **Follow-Up**: Reassess after MRI and PRP procedure; monitor for improvement or worsening symptoms.","**SBAR Clinical Note**  

**Situation**: Patient Dylan presents with bilateral elbow pain, predominantly right elbow, for approximately 1.5 years. Pain worsens with arm use, supination, and is located on the medial aspect of both elbows.  

**Background**: Patient is a weightlifter with no prior sports-related elbow injuries. Pain began 1.5 years ago; ibuprofen 800mg TID was used without relief. Icing provides no benefit. Physical exam reveals pain with flexion/extension, limited range of motion on extension, and tenderness on medial palpation. No pain on lateral palpation, normal sensation, and equal pulses.  

**Assessment**: Suspected medial epicondylitis (golfer’s elbow). No fractures or bony misalignment on x-ray. MRI ordered for further evaluation.  

**Recommendation**: Schedule MRI for confirmation. Plan for “whole blood transfusion” (blood drawn from thigh and injected into tendon) to aid healing. Consider pregnancy (patient is expecting a newborn) in timing for procedure and recovery. Monitor for progression; avoid activities exacerbating pain.","**Structure**: The note must use the SBAR handoff format with sections for Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation."

So, why, why, and I'm, because your your breathing problem can get worse very quickly, I would like you to call. Is there someone else at home with you?
Yes, my wife can take me to the emergency room, yeah.
Uh, no, I wouldn't want your wife to take you, I would like, I'd like her to call the ambulance because that might take a bit longer, and, you know, we need to deal with it quickly. So, what we are worried about is, you know, in case you develop an anaphylactic reaction.

OK. She's listening. I'll get her to call now, yeah
Yeah so, I'll ask her to give you the, um, antihistamine, in the meantime while the ambulance is coming. And take yourself to hospital.
Um, it might just be an articularly reaction, but because you're complaining of breathing difficulties, it is quite important that you go to hospital straight away.
But I'd like you to call the ambulance because, you know, so that you will be sorted out quickly.
OK.
Yeah. Alright, thank you. She's on it now. Yeah, she's on the phone.

OK. Alright then, you take care.

"Hi.
Hello. Hi, I'm Doctor Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello. Hi. So, um, just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me please? And your date of birth?

Sure, my name is Mary Smith.
My date of birth is August sixteen, nineteen seventy six.
And your email address for me, please.
My email address is Mary dot Smith at gmail dot com.
That's correct. And just to confirm, that you're in a secure location, and we can have a confidential conversation.
Absolutely.
Right. So you've mentioned that you have some pain in your jaw. Is that correct?
Um, well.
I think that's just, like, the first thing that I typed, but, uh, uh, it wasn't really what I, you know, I just typed it and then I clicked submit, so, that was uh, um.
I mean it's part of the problem but I would say that, more of a problem for me, is that I can't quite move my left arm. I mean, I can move it but it's it's numb, and then I also feel some, like tingling in my fingertips.
OK, so numbness in the left arm, yeah? How long has it been going on for?
Yes, yes.
So, I've started taking this boxing class. I've been taking this boxing class for a few weeks, and I feel like maybe, um
Mm hmm.
It's probably been, I'd say, for at least two weeks, and it's kind of gotten worse. Like,in the beginning, I just kind of felt a little bit of a tingling.
Mm-hmm.
and then it's gotten, it's gotten worse since then. Then the numbing kind of started I can feel it both in my, uh, um, you know a little bit in my elbow, and then in my arm, as well as in my hand
Mm-hmm.
And now because it hasn't gotten better, I tried to get a massage, it's not better. Or, you know, try to take warm baths. It's not better, so I figured I'd call you and, and just figure out what's going on.
Right. So, have you mentioned that message and a warm bath, any medications that you've taken so far?
Uh, well it's.
You know it's, it's numb and I, I kind of looked at stuff online, um, but you know I, I do take Ibuprofen because my muscles were sore, a little bit, and I've been taking this boxing class.
Uh huh.

So, you know, I kind of hurt like my knuckles on my right hand. So that's been a little bit painful, so I've just kind of taken ibuprofen for that.
OK.
But, like I said, I mean, I tried massage, I tried some hot baths, and that didn't help with this numbness thing.
Mmm.
Sure.
I'm just kind of getting a little worried.
Of course. So you just mentioned that your pain is from elbow downwards, is that, you know, the tingling, numbness elbow . Not from your shoulder?

And, um, well it's kind of funny, you know sometimes I will feel it in my shoulder. Like if I try to, if I try to like you know move like in boxing and stuff, I will even like, uh, um, maybe feel a little bit of, a little bit of pain.
Uh, but I would say, if i'm just like resting if I'm sitting like, right now, I can feel like it's numb, and I, I actually feel, tingling right now, not in all of my fingers, just in some.
Yeah. So, which fingers do you feel numb?
OK, so it's my second, third, and fourth finger.
Uh huh. Second, third and fourth finger. And is it your palm side or, you know, the back of your hand side which is numb, or both?
No. It's, it's the, it's this side. So, the front side.
It's the front side. OK, right. And have you been dropping things at all? Like, you know, when you try to hold onto things, like a glass or something, have dropping it?
Yes.
So not so much with the glass, but I will say, um, well I play a little bit of a piano and so I just noticed it's been kind of harder to get the notes.
Mm-hmm.
I can, I can grasp, I can grasp a a glass but because I use my right hand most of the time, you know, I'm not left handed so, it's kind of hard for me to.

So So you would say this in mind weakness, mind. So just to get my facts right. So you would say it's definitely weakness rather than because of the pain, you can't hold it. That's two different things. So you know sometimes you can't hold it because it's hurting you .
Yes.
Yeah.
No, no, it's not hurting, it's not hurting, it's, like, numb, I can't feel it, right? Well, yeah.
OK. Fine. So, you're definitely having some sort some form of weakness, OK. Edward, any neck pain at all?
Yes, absolutely.
No, not, no, nothing .
neck pain and all? OK, right, OK. So, just a bit more of a background because I don't have much information on the system. Um, do you have any past, uh, medical history that you'd like to share?
Mm hmm.
Well, I guess because of this. You know, I'm not sure if it's boxing. I also had a really bad cold, like a month ago.
Mm-hmm.
I mean, I was out, you know, drinking with, uh, friends, um, one of our co-workers just had his three year anniversary and
We kinda went crazy and we were like out partying until, you know, late hours, and I just got uncharacteristically drunk for me. And then after that, I was sick for probably good like two weeks. I was at home. I think I must have had some kind of like a flu or something.
what
Mm-hmm.
So it's that. And then, I'd say another weird thing that happened to me a few weeks ago, is like, I all of a sudden just couldn't see from the, uh, from my left eye. Like, I, I lost some, like a little bit of a field of vision
Uh, and, but that, that just lasted not very long. I mean, that just lasted maybe for, I don't know, twenty, twenty minutes?
OK.
Uh, and I kind of thought, I don't know maybe it was the the cold you know and the virus and all that so
Mm-hmm.
I, I guess that's what I can, you know, that's the last thing I can remember, but in general, I'm, I'm pretty healthy. You know, I work out, uh, , and I, I don't really have any medical problems.
Yeah.
Do you have any headaches at all, from the, in the recent past?
Um, sometimes I get headaches but I think they're just tired headaches. You know sometimes I'll get kind of
Tired but I think that's probably because I work too much. Or, you know because like I'll go for a workout and then I'll really just exhaust myself and then I just kind of feel this fatigue.
Uh, or sometimes like this morning for example, I just felt really, fatigued and I couldn't even get myself to the gym. But, you know, since I have this numbness it's kind of like, hard to workout right?
Hmm.
Do you wear glasses at all, glasses, contact lenses?
No.
No, so no glasses . And, you've not experienced anything like a seizure or a fit, anything like that?
What's a seizure?
Like when you you lose consciousness and you start shaking.
Ohh, no, no, no, no, nothing like that, mmm mmm.
OK, no fits, yeah, OK. And your weakness is only in your left arm. Legs are walking and all this, normal, yeah?
Right, exactly.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, walking is normal, yeah.
You mentioned for a while you couldn't see, you know, the outside peripheral vision from your left eye. How long did that episode last for?
You know I think it was only maybe like twenty minutes or so. It's almost like it happened and I thought ohh my God. It's probably I'm still like sick from this, you know virus thing, cold, and so I just kind of slacked it off. And then when I, uh, um, when I woke up it was gone.
Sure, OK. Um, OK. So is there any regular medications that you're using?
Not really. I just take ibuprofen every once in a while, I take vitamin D. Um, I take some I, I like my my GP really wants me to take iron supplements, but you know, they're just like huge pills so I, I, most of the time I just forget.
OK.
But, vitamin D I take. And then, sometimes I take Melatonin to help me sleep.
OK
Alright.
And any family history you'd like to share? Any significant family history?
I know that my dad has I don't know if it it's hypo, I think it's hypothyroidism.
Yeah.
Um, and then my, like, he's got he's got some autoimmune stuff going on, like that much I know.
Mm-hmm.
And then, my mom, my mom, she's actually not in a great shape. She's got diabetes type two.
She's got hypertension, um, she's got, gosh, what is it, ohh, yeah, she's got high cholesterol, um, and I think that's it for her. Yeah.
Yeah, right. Any neurological conditions in the family?
Uh.
there are related conditions. No, OK, that's fine.


OK, so, right. So after, you know, speaking and examining, you know, yourself, I think it's quite important that we do investigate it a bit further. I'm just wondering whether there's something a bit more than just the boxing here.
OK, few things that's, made me think other than, just like a boxing injury, is for instance, um, you know, when you said you can't, your vision went, your peripheral vision was not there for about twenty. So, and that with the weakness of the arms, make me think, is there something else going on rather than just an injury?
OK.


What do you think may be going on?
sometimes you know you do get things like MS, multiple sclerosis. So people with multiple sclerosis can have, um, visual problems, like what you've experienced and sometimes you know the odd numbness tingling sensations going on. OK?
Ohh!
Ohh my God! Will I be in a wheelchair?
We, if we capture it a bit early there are treatments for it. OK? I'm not, obviously I'm not suggesting that you do have it, but it is quite important to find out that, whether you have it or not that's the most serious kind of thing that needs to be, uh, dealt with here.
Yeah. So, what we can do is I'm going to do an urgent, very urgent neurology referral. Yeah? What they, what that might entail is the brain scan and things like that. Hello?
K, OK.
OK
I see. Yeah yeah yeah! Yeah, I'm here, I'm here.
I know this might sound a bit of a shock to you, um, but I'm, I think it is more important that we investigate this a bit more seriously.
Yeah.
Alright. Yeah, that makes sense.
OK. Any questions at all?
Well, what's, OK, so you're gonna do the referral, um, should I be taking any drugs or, um
No, that's something we can't do. The treatment for it is actually some steroids and things like that, uh, when you have an acute you know, acute reaction or things like that. But, saying that, first we need to firm diagnosis.
Yeah. While you're waiting for this to be done, if there's any weakness, uh, you know, if the weakness progresses to your legs, or there's any kind of headaches, vomiting, fits, and your visual symptoms are getting worse and not getting better, then that would be an A and E.
Mm hmm, yes, OK.
OK, got it.
Alright.
Sounds good! OK, thank you, doctor.
Yeah. I'm I'm sorry. I, I do appreciate you are a bit worried, but, you know, it's good that we know that you've come and spoken to us today, and hopefully we'll get things sorted and the ball rolling. OK?
Thank you, doctor. Appreciate your time.
That's OK. You take care.
Thank you.
Bye bye!
Good bye now, bye.","**Clinical Note**

OK. When you say you can't drink too much, why is that?
Uh, yeah because, really I, uh I, um, I'm like, I feel like I don't drink enough, like I'm, I'm drink, I'm trying to drink, but then I just go to the loo, and I like, I, uh I, I, I do everything and I feel dehydrated again.
OK, alright. Um have you managed to eat anything, solids?
Uh, not much, not much. So just a little bit, but I don't feel, um, I don't really feel like, uh, I have appetite.
OK. You . OK. Um with your um, the vomiting has now stopped. Is that right? You said
Yes, yes.

OK, alright. Have you had any other symptoms, like fever or temperature?
Uh, so, not, really I , I feel a little bit warm, um, probably at, at the beginning I was feeling I had a bit of temperature, but now I feel, I feel kind of fine.
OK.
I feel very weak though.
OK. Alright. Any headaches or muscle pains?
Not, not really, no.
OK, alright. And you mentioned three days ago. What were you doing when the symptoms started? Are you aware of any triggers?
, not that I, I remember, what was I doing, I, I was at home I was working, on my computer and.
Yeah, just felt, like some nausea and I had to, to vomit, and then I had some diarrhoea, straight after that.
Yeah. Did you have any takeaway food, or any dodgy restaurant food?
Uh, not that I remember, no.
OK. Have you been around anyone unwell, with diarrhea recently, last week or so?
Hmm, not that I know, not that I.
OK. OK. Um, right. So moving on, um are you otherwise fit and well?
Yeah, yeah, .
Uh OK. And do you take any regular medications?
Um, so I, I do suffer of asthma. So, I do have my inhalers, uh, that I you know, I need, I use infrequently, let's say only when I have, uh, a bit of .
Is that, is that inhaler?
Sorry?
Is that the blue inhaler? Blue inhaler. OK, alright. Any other medications that you take?
Yes it is, yeah.
Uh, no, nothing.
OK. Do you have any allergies to medications?
Um, not that I know of.
OK. And any family history of any medical problems?
Um, so, my father has, high uh, well used to have high blood pressure. He actually, so he actually died, of, bowel cancer, like ten years ago.
OK. Sorry to hear that. Um, OK. And uh what about your mother?
Ohh yes, so uh, probably is worth mentioning uh, she has diabetes.
Diabetes. Do you know if that's type one or type two?
Uh, it's type two.
OK. Alright.
Fine. And um, just a little bit more about your life in general, sir. Um who, who's at home with you? Who lives at home with you?
Sorry?
Who lives at home with you, sir?
Ohh I, I live alone.
You live alone, OK. Are you currently working at the moment?
Uh, well I haven't been able to work in the past few days, but yes , like given, uh, my uh.
What's your employment? What do you do for work?
I'm a software engineer.
. OK, alright.
Have you taken time off work recently?
Uh, yes, yes I have, uh. Uh, these last three days I've been feeling, really unwell, so I couldn't work.
OK, alright. And just the last couple of questions with, regarding your smoking and alcohol. Do you do either of those?
Uh, not really, I drink infrequently, like socially let's say, and I don't smoke.
OK, alright. Um fine. uh Robert um
having listened to your story, I think you're probably suffering from what we call gastroenteritis, uh which essentially is just a, a tummy bug. It's an infection of your, your tummy. Um and normally lasts about three to five days, and gets better.
OK.
All right.
the things you can do to really help yourself get better soon, um are you can drink plenty of fluids. Really try and flush the toxins out of your body.
OK.
Uh you can get things from the pharmacy, which is called Dioralyte, which can help replenish any uh minerals and vitamins you may have lost. Uh, it's called Dioralyte. Um it's, it's a, it's a type of fluid replacement drink.
I'm sorry, what's the name of that?

Um, you can take some Paracetamol if you're feeling feverish and weak.
All right.
I would probably advise you to continue taking time off work for next day or two, until you get better.
normally you have to be diarrhea-free for about twenty four to forty eight hours, before you return back to work.
OK.
Um, let's see how the next few days go. And if you're still not better next week, I want you to come back and see me.
And we can have another look at your symptoms, OK?
That sounds good, that sounds good. Uh, thanks so much.
Thanks. do you have any questions for me, or?
Um, no I think that's fine. Uh, yeah I'll, I'll try to , and drink , drink plenty of fluid and I hope it go away. Uh, if it doesn't I'll uh, I'll call, I'll call back. Is that OK?

I really hope you get better soon.
Thanks a lot. Thanks so much, for your time.

"Hello?
Hi there, it's Doctor Smith from Babylon.
Uh, hi, Doctor Smith.
Hi there. Could you give me your full name, date of birth, and your, the first line of your address, please?
Um, I.



Your full name, date of birth, and your address, please? Yeah, OK.
Yeah, my name is Barbara .
Um, and my date of birth, fourth October, nineteen eighty four.
OK.
And address fifty Avenue.
OK. Are you in a private place so you can have a confidential consultation today?
Yes, I am.
What can I do for you?
Um, I've just been for the past couple of days. I've been having this serious diarrhoea and this really,
Giving me trouble.
OK. So when did it start?
It was three days ago.
Now.
OK. And when you say diarrhoea, what do you mean by that? Is it watery or just loose?
It's, it's, it's very loose but it started as being very watery.
OK. And how many times are you going to the toilet?

I lost count, um.
Today alone, I've been at least four time.
OK. And any, any high temperatures? Are you feeling feverish?
Yes, I've been running a serious temperature. I'm literally boiling.
Have you checked your temperature with a thermometer?
No, 'cause I've not got one but like, to the touch, I'm, like, literally roasting.
OK. Um, and any nausea or vomiting?
Yes, I've been throwing up. I can't keep to, uh, I can't seem to be able to keep anything in me. Not even water, not even my tea, not even any liquid stuff. I've just been throwing up everything.
OK. And when, when were you last sick?
Um, I was sick just after trying, uh, trying to have breakfast this morning, so maybe about two hours ago.
OK. And have you been passing water OK?
Yeah, I've been, I've been, yeah, urinating OK. Is that what you mean, like?
Yeah, yeah, urinating, yeah. Any, and what sort of color is the urine?
To be honest, I have a look so I really couldn't say.
OK.
OK. And when did you last pass urine, do you think?
Um.
an hour ago.
OK.
And any blood in the stool or in the urine that you've noticed?
No blood.
OK.
Any episodes like this before? How's your bowels normally?
Sorry, I didn't catch that.
How is your bowels normally?
Ah, ah, my, my bowels is normally fine. I would normally go to the toilet every day. You know, in the morning, just once, yeah, and that's fine.
OK.
Any episodes of diarrhoea or constipation normally?
No.
And is there anything you think might have triggered this off? Have you been abroad anywhere?
No, but then, um, my, um my brother, um, has actually been having similar symptoms, um, for the past, um, few days as well, and he does say like everyone in school's got this so, I, I don't know, that might, that might be something.
So you've been in contact with him, have you?
Yes.
OK. Um, and any other medical problems?

Have you had any other symptoms at the moment, like rash?
No, no rash, no, nothing that, um.
No.
OK. Um, any surgery before, or abdominal problems, or any other medical issues?
Well, apart from the fact that this one is giving me abdominal pains, no previous abdominal pains before. Obviously I get the odd, um, you know, menstrual cramps and all that but, you know, that's, you know, that comes and goes.
Yeah.
OK. And whereabouts is the pain that you're getting?
Um, it's kind of like towards my navel area, like I can't touch my navel area. It's just so sore. And it gets, yeah, it's almost like the center of my navel.

Um, and does the pain come and go?
Yes, it does come. When it comes, I feel this strong urge to go to the, to the loo, and then and sort of like comes again, it comes and.
OK.
Um, and do you take any medication regularly?
Well, I, I take my, my vitamins, vitamin D, every day. That's about, that's about all that I regularly take.
OK.
And have you got a normal diet?
Yeah, I eat well, normally.
Right. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
Well, I don't smoke, but, you know, I have a pint from time to time.
And do you take any other drugs?
No. Like I said, I only take, um, vitamins. And for my menstrual cramps, when they come, maybe I might take a, a, an ibuprofen just to ease the pain, but.
And when was, when was your last period?
Um, two weeks ago.
OK. Are you on any contraception?
No.
Are you having regular sexual intercourse?
No.
OK.
Um, and what's your job?
Um, um, uh.
Um, uh.
A graphics designer.
Have you had to miss work because of this problem?
Well, yes, I've had to actually work from home today. I'm working from home today because I can't, I can't be out for work.
OK.
And who do you live with at home?
I live with my brother and my mum.
OK. OK.
And, um, have you tried anything yourself for this problem?
Well, I've tried a home remedy. Um, I've tried the, the, uh, ORS, you know, thing I bought from my, my local, my local, uh.
Um.
What? Could you just repeat that?
The ORS, the, the salt sugar ORS, um, um, mix, the salt sugar mix.
OK. And how often have you been taking that?
Yeah.
I've taken that, I've taken that, like, um, three times a day for the past two days.
OK. Um, and do you feel like your symptoms are easing off, or getting worse, or ?
I, I, I they're not getting any better, 'cause like I said, I've been, I've been vomiting literally everything I take, so, so I doubt that even that had, had the chance to work.
Yeah.
OK.
Um.
I mean, it sounds like, because your brother's had a similar thing, it sounds like it might be some, an infectious gastroenteritis that you've got, which is usually caused by a virus. But, it can be from something you've eaten, as well. Um.
If the symptoms, they do normally start to settle by themselves with the oral rehydration salts. Um, if the symptoms are continuing to get worse, the key thing is that we want to make sure that you're hydrated enough.
Um, sometimes you do require certain medication to help this, if it's, sometimes if it's caused by a bacteria. Um, what I would say, probably worth as it's been going on for a few days and you feel like it's not starting to ease off.
I think it's probably important to get a sample of the stool, so we can make sure that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection which needs specific treatment.
OK.
Um, and we should also check that you're not getting dehydrated, because if you're, if you're not keeping fluid down, then you can get dehydrated.
Um, so.
So, how, how do I, how do I get myself hydrated when I'm not able to even, like, drink water? I'm throwing up everything.
Yeah. So you need to carry on with your rehydration salts, and just have very small amounts. It's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago. So, you're obviously still, um, hydrated enough to pass urine.
OK.
But we, um, we should see you so that we can check your hydration and, um, get that sample sent off as soon as possible.
'cause if, if, if you come into the clinic, you can send that sample off straightaway. Otherwise, we would have to post it out to you which would take time.
OK.
Ohh, OK. So, when can I come to the clinic to have this done?
Um, so we can, we can make you an urgent appointment, um, and then you can, you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration. Um, but if, in the meantime, you're feeling more unwell, then we would get you seen urgently in A and E.
OK.
So you can call us back in the meantime.
OK. So, what I'll do is, yeah. If you could, please book me the appointment and, um, yeah, I'll see how I feel, um, for the end of the day. Hopefully I don't need to go to the A and E, and, um .
Yeah. If you keep drinking, keep going with the rehydration salts. Just tiny sips constantly, to so that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and, and you vomit, so just tiny, tiny sips but just keep going with it.
Um, and just have very simple food, if you're gonna have anything, like toast or biscuit or something really light like that. Avoid, um, fruit, vegetables, uh, milk, anything like that, which might just make it worse.
Mm-hmm.
OK.
OK. So you'll have to book an appointment through the support line.
OK.
Yes, please.
Right, OK. We'll do that for you.

OK, take care.
Thank you.
Thanks, bye.","**Clinical Note**

"[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 .
[doctor] hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ?
[patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .
[patient] yes , i did .
[doctor] anything new since your last visit ?
[patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .
[doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?
[patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .
[doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .
[patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?
[doctor] yep , right here .
[patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .
[doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .
[patient] that would be great .
[doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .
[patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .
[doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .
[patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?
[doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .
[patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .
[doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?
[patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so , i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freer since , um , i'll be on vacation after july 8th .
[doctor] okay , good .
[patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?
[doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ?
[patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .
[doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...
[patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .
[doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .
[patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .
[doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you .
[patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .
[doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .
[patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .
[doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .
[patient] okay , thank you . got it .
[doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?
[patient] no , not that i know of .
[doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .
[doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?
[patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .
[doctor] okay . we might give you some of that .
[patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .
[doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?
[patient] yes , i also do have that problem .
[doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .
[patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .
[doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , sounds good .
[patient] great .
[doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .
[patient] okay , i will do that .
[doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .
[patient] okay , that's okay .
[doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .
[patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .
[doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .
[doctor] okay , great . let's see them .
[patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .
[doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 .
[patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .
[doctor] yeah , this is much better .
[patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .
[doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .
[patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?
[doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .
[patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .
[doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan .
[patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?
[doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .
[patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?
[doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] does that make sense ?
[patient] yes , it does .
[doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .
[patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?
[doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .
[patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .
[doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .
[patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .
[doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .
[patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .
[patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .
[doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .
[patient] okay , will do .
[doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .
[patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .
[doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .
[patient] okay .

[patient] yes , that sounds great .
[doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .
[patient] okay , that would be great .
[doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] if you need some , uh , just let me know .
[patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know .
[doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .
[patient] okay , great , thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[doctor] so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .","**SOAP Note**

"Hello.
Hi there.
Hi! Hi there. Uh, my name's Joe. I'm one of the doctors at Babylon. I, just, can I confirm your name please?
, yeah. Uh, my name's .
Makes sense. Yeah.
So, . Sorry, your name is?
Name was Brian.
Brian. Hi Brian. Nice to
Hi.
Um, uh, and your date of birth.
Yeah, my date of birth is the eighth of August, nineteen eighty two.

Great. And uh, are you in a sort of, uh, confidential place where you can speak freely?
Yeah. No, no one else can hear me.
Great. And you're happy to continue with the consultation.
Yes.
Marvelous. OK. So, um, how can i help today?
Yeah, um. So basically it's, just been happening over the last few weeks or so.
But I don't really feel like um, like, getting up in the morning's really difficult, and I don't have much energy at all, during the day, um.
Often.
Yeah just like, doing most things that I would normally find, easy , is become quite difficult.
OK. So, things have become quite difficult for you.
Yeah.
Is there anything else?
Um, no it's quite hard to say like. Things like, I'm not, I'm not eating very much at the moment. I just don't feel like I have a lot of energy.
OK. I'm sorry to hear that.
Um, so you had difficulty waking up. No energy, not eating.
And that's been going on for a few weeks. When you say a few weeks, do you mean two or three or five? how many hours of sleep?
Actually, well, now I kind of think about it maybe, maybe even longer, um. I guess uh, , might be related to, so I also started a new job, um, slightly recently.
Um. It might of even coincided, coincided with uh, with that, job, a couple of months ago.
When did you start your new job? Two months ago, did you say?
Yeah.

OK. And, um, so this has been going on perhaps for um, sort of, six weeks or so?
More like, , two months, I would say, yeah.
OK.
Alright. So, um,
Is there anything that you're particularly, sort of concerned about, um, or hoping to get out of this consultation?
Well, um, I, I know that it's not really normal for me, so, before this phase. So I'd have thing, you know I wouldn't have, uh, any problems sort of.
, eating, what I want to eat, or you know, doing standard things in life, and, and, what I want, to do is just like, kind of return to that previous state.
Uh, somehow. Um, I'm not sure how that is. Uh, what, what the best ways of doing that are, but, yeah. Do you have some advice or?

Whatever, that'd be really useful.
OK. Sure. OK. Um, well what would I like to do is just ask you a few more, sort of questions around what's been going on, um, and also around your background health and um, and things like that.
And then we can go on to sort of what can be done from there. Is that alright?
OK.
OK, great. so you say you've been, um, feeling unwell with not a lot of energy, difficult waking up in the mornings. Do you tend to just on that , do you tend to wake up early, and then stay in bed in the morning?
Um, actually I'm, just uh, not, not really waking up early. It's more like I'm just having trouble sleeping at all, really. I think that's probably closer.
, difficulty sleeping as well.
Yeah.
Um, and have you, and, how, how has your mood been over this period?
Have you been feeling your usual self?
Um.
Distracted, , I'd say. Uh, I, I kind of, um.
Yeah, uh, finding it really hard to, quite, difficult to keep focusing, I would say.
Um, not unhappy or, happy, but just uh, quite, just , not focused.
OK. So difficulty focusing, quite distracted.
And, would you say you've been in good spirits? Or is your mood low?
Um.
Actually uh, now you, you, you mention it like, my, mood is a bit lower recently.
Um, and so I've noticed like, uh, my sex drive has kind of decreased, um, a bit over the, the past few months as well, so, yeah.
Right.
K. And uh, so lower mood, decreased sex drive recently as well.
And, just on that note, just a few questions around that.
Are you able to, uh, it may be slightly personal questions, but if you're O. O. K. to answer this,
Do you tend to, to have morning erections like you, is that something that you've noticed, ?
Yeah.
Um, I haven't noticed anything like that, specifically, no.
So, you've not, so you're saying you have not noticed morning erections, and usually you would. So, normal thing to have, uh, waking up in the morning with something. But you have not noticed those recently.
Yes.
I have not noticed those recently.
OK. So, and that's been a change, has it?
Um.
Important one I don't think, um, yeah. Not, I don't think it's important to change, no.
Sorry?
Uh, so you, you, you, you don't think there's been a change there. You
No, there hasn't been a change there.
Ohh OK, sorry. Right, so
OK. So, um,
Just going back to the mood symptoms as well. Uh, you have had uh, difficulty focusing, easily distracted. Your mood has been uh, slightly lower, with lower sex drive.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, and in what way has your sex drive been lower? are you in a relationship at the moment?
Yeah, I, I'm married, um, have been for, many years.
Mm-hmm.
And, uh, yeah just, um. Over the last few months, just uh, been disinterested.
Disinterested.
OK.
OK. Sorry, you froze there for a moment.
Um, . So less interested as well, OK.

Yeah.
And, just to ask you a few questions before we uh, wrap up is, uh, any significant past medical history?
Um, so do you suffer from any, uh, mental health problems in the past, or any, uh, physical health problems?
Um, so, in the past, um, I have a, a history of, hypothyroidism, um.
Hypo?
Hypothyroidism.
Hyperthyroid.
Yeah.
K, so that's high thyroid, just to sort of confirm that.
Um.
Sorry, can you say that again please?
hyper, as in high, hyperthyroid.
Hypo.
Hypo, OK. Hypothyroid. Thank you.
Thank you. Um.
Yeah, and uh, also in the past, I mean, I haven't had any kind of specific, uh, medical diagnoses, along these lines.
OK.
Um, but the suspicion, that it may have uh, had an impact on me, but my father has commited suicide, um, about fifteen years ago.
OK.
OK. And um,
Uh, do you take any medications?
I had a, a, drug history of Thyroxine.
Mm-hmm.
So, maybe, yes.
Do you, do you continue to take Thyrocsin now?
Yes.
You do. You're, so you're taking Thyrocsin at the moment?
Um.
Yes.
Cool. And any drug allergies? Are you allergic to any medications?
No, I have no uh, medication allergies, no.
No.
No allergies. And you mentioned the , the suicide of your father fifteen years ago. I'm very sorry to hear that. Is there any other, um, uh, significant family history of medical conditions, or psychiatric conditions?
No.
No depression or anything like that running in your family, or uh,
Uh, nothing, nothing, that sort.
OK. And your mother is, is well? Any brothers or sisters?
Yeah she's fine, um, and no, I'm an only child. Um.
Um,
OK.
So, I just uh, uh, sorry it might seem like a slightly random question, but any uh, change in vision?
No
No, no, nothing like that.
. OK. And, just to go back to your, you were saying you had low mood. Some people who , who do have low mood, uh, and low sex drive can sometimes feel uh, suicidal as well. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or harming anyone else?
No.
No.
No, not , not really, no.
and are you able to get the usual enjoyment out of your daily activities, that you have done in the past?
Sometimes, I mean, I guess, um, most of the activites, but, when I've been doing sports as well, , I find sometimes it's quite difficult to breathe, um.
So, I have some kind of like, shortness of breath um, when doing, sports, compared to maybe a couple of months ago.
OK. So you, you've become more short of breath over the last few months.
Yeah.
Um, and you've had a
OK. So uh, any other things around that? So, more fatigue, more shortness of breath, um, over the last few months?
Mmm.
Um, with a low, lower mood, decreased sex drive. Um, is there, just before we wrap up, is there anything else that you would like to talk about?
Um, no, nothing specific, no.
So, um,
We're getting a little bit towards the end now, but I would quite like to make a bit more of a plan for you. Um,
I would like to, probably see you in person, and do an examination. And, and also, we would probably like to do some blood tests um, as well.
So, do you think it would be possible to see uh, to to book an appointment in the next few days uh, with your GP? Or, or um, that would be ideal, I think here.
Um, and then we can, we can probably do some more uh, we'll do an examination and uh, do some investigations really, to see what's going on here a little bit more.
, yes.
That makes sense, yeah.
Is that alright?
Yeah, that's very useful, thank you, um.
OK.
Yeah, it feels, better to have some kind of plan, uh.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think , I definitely think we need a plan here. Um, it's been nice talking to you. I'm sorry, we've run out of time now.
Uh, but we've at least started the ball rolling with um, some further investigations and tests.
I'm glad you're, you know, you're, you're , you're, although you have a low mood, um, you're, you're, um, you're not feeling suicidal, just to confirm that.
Mm-hmm, yes.
And, and you're, uh, and uh, we'll hopefully get to the bottom of some your tiredness, and your other symptoms, when we see you. OK?
Thank you very much, for taking the time. Thank you.
OK. Thank you. Thanks.","**History and Physical (H&P)**

"[doctor] hi ms. hernandez , dr. fisher , how are you ?
[patient] hi dr. fisher . i'm doing okay except for my elbow here .
[doctor] all right . so it's your right elbow ?
[patient] it's my right elbow , yes .
[doctor] okay . hey dragon , ms. hernandez is a 48-year-old female here for a right elbow . so , tell me what happened .
[patient] well , i was , um , moving to a new home-
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i was , um , moving boxes from the truck into the house and i lifted a box up and then i felt like this popping-
[doctor] hmm .
[patient] and this strain as i was lifting it up onto the shelf .
[doctor] okay . and when- when did this happen ?
[patient] this was just yesterday .
[doctor] all right . and have you tried anything for it ? i mean ...
[patient] i put ice on it . and i've been taking ibuprofen , but it still hurts at lot .
[doctor] okay , what makes it better or worse ?
[patient] the ice , when i have it on , is better .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but , um , as soon as , you know , i take it off then it starts throbbing and hurting again .
[doctor] all right . uh , let's review your past medical history . uh ... looks like you've got a history of anaphylaxis , is that correct ?
[patient] yes . yes , i do . yeah .
[doctor] do you take any medications for it ?
[patient] um , ep- ... just an epipen .
[doctor] just epipen for anaphylaxis when you need it . um , and what surgeries have you had before ?
[patient] yeah , so carotid . yeah-
[doctor] . yeah , no , uh , your , uh , neck surgery .
all right . well let's , uh , examine you here for a second .
so it's your , uh , this elbow right here ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] and is it hurt- ... tender right around that area ?
[patient] yes , it is .
[doctor] okay . can you flex it or can you bend it ?
[patient] it hurts when i do that , yeah .
[doctor] all right . and go ahead and straighten out as much as you can .
[patient] that's about it .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so there's some swelling there . and how about , uh , can you move your fingers okay ? does that hurt ?
[patient] no , that's fine .
[doctor] how about right over here ?
[patient] uh , no that's fine . yeah .
[doctor] okay . so on exam you've got some tenderness over your lateral epicondyle . uh , you have some swelling there and some redness . uh , you have some pain with flexion , extension of your elbow as well . uh , and you have some pain on the dorsal aspect of your- of your forearm as well . okay ? so let's look at your x-rays . hey dragon , show me the x-rays . all right . your x-ray of your elbow-
it looks like , i mean , the bones are lined up properly . there's no fracture-
[doctor] . it , uh , there's a little bit of swelling there on the lateral elbow but i do n't see any fracture , so that's good . so , looking at the x-ray and looking at your exam , uh , my diagnosis here would be lateral epicondylitis , and this is basically inflammation of this area where this tendon in- inserts . and probably that happened when you were moving those boxes . so we'll try some motrin , uh , about 800 milligrams every six hours . uh , i'll give you a sling for comfort , just so you can use it if- if it's causing a lot of pain .
[patient] hmm .
[doctor] and it should get better , uh , in about , you know , in a couple of days it should be improved . and if it does n't get better , give us a call and we'll see you some time next week . okay ? so we'll give you a sling , we'll give you the motrin , i'll give you about , uh , 30 , uh , uh , 30 , uh , uh , medications for that . uh , do you have any questions ?
[patient] no , no . thank you .
[doctor] hey dragon , order the medications and the procedures . all right , why do n't you come with me and we'll get you signed out ?
[patient] okay , sounds good .

"There's no . , hello?
. Hi there.
Hello there. Um, thanks for, thanks for, being here. Um, before I go any further, can I uh, confirm your name and your age please?
Yes, it's um Adriana Katherine . And I'm twenty six year old.

OK, Adriana, and how can I help you this afternoon?
Well, I have this like really crazy headache that's been going on for a few days. And it really annoys me.
Ohh dear, OK. , when, when did it exactly start, this headache?
Eh, around three days ago, maybe.
Three days ago, OK. And whereabout in your head, is this pain?
Um, it's basically like, it kind of feels all over my head, but like mainly, um, around my right eye. Um
, OK. Um, and is the, headache there all the time, or does it come and go?
Um it's, it kind of comes and goes. Um but, I mean it is there all the time, but like sometimes it's stronger.
OK, so it comes and, fine, OK. And if I was to ask you on a scale of one to ten, um, ten being the worst type of pain you ever had. How would you rate this headache?
Ohh it's probably a eight.
Eight. And if I was to ask you describe the headache to me, um, in terms of the nature of the pain. Is it sharp? Is it dull? Is it crampy? Is it throbbing?
Um, it's kind of, it's dull but sometimes it gets a bit sharper. So basically it like, it developed gradually, I guess. It's like the first day it just started when I was at work.
Mm-hmm.
And by the end of the day it was like pretty, pretty, like it was a lot, basically. And then I was thinking OK, maybe I'll just go to sleep. And when I woke up the next morning like, it was even, even worse basically. So
Mm-hmm.
So, you think the headache is getting worse over the last three days?
Yeah.
OK. Have you tried anything which has made the headache better?
Um so I tried uh Ibuprofen. Um so I took, like a few. Um for the last two days, basically.
Did that help?
But it doesn't really help, no. In in the past it did help me, which is why I decided to try it. But
OK, all right. And except for the headaches, any other symptoms at all?
Um
So, example any, problems your eyesight or your vision?
Not really, but just when it started, I I got this like weird shooting lights. And like now like light is quite annoying, my eyes.
So when you say annoying, does it hurt to look, uh, look at bright lights?
Yeah, yeah. It hurts. So
, OK. And um, have you had any loss of vision or blurry vision?
Not loss of vision, I wouldn't say. It's just like some lights from, shooting lights .
Mmm, , OK. Any nausea or any vomiting?
Um, well I'm like basically, I I'm sick with the headache. But I, no vomiting.
When you say sick, you mean you feel sick? OK. Yeah, no vomiting, OK. Any neck pain or neck stiffness?
Yeah.
No.
OK. And any difficulty with speaking or, um, speech?
No.
Any difficulty , with weakness in your arms and legs?
No, it's hard to focus though. So, I I had to take a couple of days off work, actually.
Ohh really? OK. OK, yeah probably, well I'll, I'll ask you a bit more about your work later on. Um, any recent head injuries at all?
Uh, no.
OK. And have you had anything like this before in the past?
Yeah I mean, headaches, you mean.
Or, uh, or similar, similar to, similar to this kind of headache, ?
Yeah. I mean I had. But, usually after I I take uh Ibuprofen it kind of goes away. So, but this time it's just not. .
not, OK. All right. Um, any temperatures, or fevers?
No.
Any rashes at all, on your skin?
Mm, no not that I've noticed.
OK. And just moving forwards. Are you otherwise fit and well, Adriana?
Am I what, sorry?
You fit and well? , do you have any other medical history?
Yeah, I think so. It's just the headache.
Any history of migraines at all?
Not myself, I've never had a migraine. But my sister and my mom have them quite frequently.
OK. Um, fine. I'll ask you a bit more about that in just a second. Before I go any further, can I ask, do you take any regular medication?
Uh, no no.
Are you on the pill?
OK. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
Mm not that I know of.
OK. So you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines.
Yeah.
Are they, is that normally well-controlled or are they um, having difficulty, controlling their symptoms?
Um so my sister's, like better. Like it's kind of, it's very rare. But my mom's is like quite bad, um usually when there's like a season changing and stuff like that. It's, yeah.
Mm-hmm, OK.
Takes her out for a few days, basically.
Ohh right, OK, fine. Um, socially, tell me a bit more about your life, outside of, um, outside of, work. So , who lives at home with you?
Uh I live with housemates. So, three of them. So we're four .
OK. Excellent. And are you working at the moment? You mentioned this , impacting on your work.
Yeah so I work, well I work in IT. So I work with computers a lot. So it kind of is difficult to focus. Um I had to like reduce the uh, brightness of my screen.
Mmm. OK. Do you wear glasses?
Yes, I do.
Have you had any, uh, have you had any recent eye check, done? Eye test?
No, uh I've been wearing them since I was five , five year old. So, it's quite a long time.
OK, all right. Something for you to bear in mind if you feel that you are, your eyes are straining. Um I would always recommend having a repeat eye test done. Um, have you been feeling more stressed or anxious at work recently?

Well, it's been a bit stressful, kicking off a new project. But um, yeah nothing out of the ordinary, really.
OK, all right. Great. Um, regarding smoking or alcohol. Do you drink or smoke at all?
I socially smoke. And I drink only socially.
But only socially?
OK.
Right. Now um, Adriana, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Have you, have you read anything online, or spoken to people?
Um
Not really. Um at first I thought it's stress, or maybe I didn't drink enough water. Because sometimes when I don't drink enough water, I I like get headaches. Um
Mm-hmm.
But, I don't think that's it. And I'm like worried, it's, I don't want it to be a migraine. Because I know what it's like, from my mom and my sister.

Mmm.
And it's really annoying. So I I really don't want to have that. And I know it's genetic. So I've researched that. Um but I don't know if that is the case. So, yeah.
OK. Is it anything in particular you were hoping I could do for you today?
Yeah maybe just kinda, if you have any recommendations of that I can take something stronger. Because apparently, Ibuprofen doesn't help me. Uh
OK.
Usually it gets resolved if I have headache in like, after like one or two days. But currently it, it didn't help me.
How many tablets did you take of Ibuprofen?
Uh, three a day.
Three a day, OK. All right. Um, so uh, Adriana, so um, really what I think is going on here. I , uh, unfortunately I do think this could be, a headache very similar to a migraine.

Um, the reason I say that is because the history is very suggestive of it, given your mum and your sister also migraines. I think it's something for us to think about.
Um, now I'm not saying it's gonna, keep happening, but, it may just be a one-off. But it's certainly worth treating it today stronger analgesia or painkillers.
Um, now moving forward, we have some options which we can discuss. Uh, you tried the Ibuprofen. Now, my only worry is, I'm not sure whether you're taking, the correct dose. You can take up to two tablets, three times a day.
Ohh right.
So, so , there's definitely room for, improvement there. Or, I can prescribe you something stronger, like Naproxen, which is another anti-inflammatory, which can be helpful.
Mm-hmm.
Um, we can also add in other, painkillers like, Paracetamol, or Codeine. Which might be helpful as well.
Mm, yeah. I think is what my mom takes for when she has um, um migraines.
OK. And I think it's , certainly worth looking into that, so I can give you a , prescription for that today. Um, with regards to um, the next few days. It may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out what's, you know, if there's any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse.
Mm-hmm.
And, and, you know I'd like you to come back and see me, in about uh, a week's time, week to two weeks' time.
If you are having , more frequent episodes of these type of headaches. We can think about giving you medications as, prophylactic. Which basically means, medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis. But we can have that discussion next time.
Mm, OK.
OK. In the meantime if your headaches aren't getting any better, or they're getting worse. Um, you know, I want you to give me a call, or come back and see me sooner. OK?
OK. Yeah.
So, if you're having any problems with your vision, or weakness in your arms and legs, or you're just not feeling very well. Just give me a call, and come back and see me.
OK.
All right?
Great.
Great. Well, have a good day.
Thank you. You too. Bye!
Bye.","Adriana Katherine, 26-year-old female, presented with a three-day history of severe headache (rated 8/10) localized to the right eye and diffusely across the head, with intermittent sharp pain. Symptoms began at work, progressively worsening over 24 hours, with maximal intensity upon waking the following day. Headache is constant but fluctuates in severity, accompanied by photophobia (pain with bright light), visual disturbances (shooting lights), and neck stiffness. No loss of vision or blurry vision, though light sensitivity is notable. She reports difficulty focusing, leading to two days of work absence.  

Past medical history is unremarkable except for a family history of migraines (mother and sister), with maternal migraines associated with seasonal triggers and prolonged disability. No prior headaches, though ibuprofen (3 tablets/day) was taken for two days without efficacy, unlike previous episodes. No nausea, vomiting, or neurological deficits (e.g., weakness, speech difficulty).  

Social history includes glasses use since age 5, no recent eye exam, social smoking, and occasional alcohol consumption. No regular medications or allergies.  

Clinical impression: Headache consistent with migraine, given family history, photophobia, visual aura, and treatment resistance to ibuprofen.  

Plan:  
- Review ibuprofen dosage (max 2 tablets TID).  
- Prescribe naproxen (anti-inflammatory) and consider paracetamol/codeine for adjunctive analgesia.  
- Advise headache diary to identify triggers.  
- Schedule follow-up in 1–2 weeks; return sooner if symptoms worsen, new neurological deficits (e.g., vision changes, weakness), or inadequate response to treatment.  
- Reiterate importance of eye exam if visual symptoms persist.","Adriana Katherine, 26-year-old female, presents with a three-day history of severe headache (rated 8/10) localized to the right eye, with dull, intermittent sharp pain.

Patient reports prior headaches responsive to ibuprofen (3 tablets/day), but current episode unresponsive. Family history of migraines in mother and sister. No fever, rash, or recent head injury. Works in IT, wears glasses (no recent eye exam). Social smoker and occasional alcohol use.

"Hello?
Hello?
Hello? Can you hear me OK?
Hello.
Uh I can hear you, but I can't really see you.
That's perfect. Um
Is, is that OK? Am I meant to
this audio. And then it's absolutely fine.
Just connection on the screen.
Uh, now before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your age?
OK.
Um so, um my name is uh Dan Choudhry. I am seven, twenty seven.
Twenty seven, OK. And how can I help you this afternoon, Dan?
Um so I've just um, been having some troubles, basically in the uh, I guess it's been a little while now. And I've just been feeling not so great. And
It's all come from like, uh it's like basically I think it's diarrhoea. And it's like just coming out, like loads of it. Like I go to the toilet and it's just super watery and it
Yeah it doesn't feel very solid. It so, it just, it's just pouring straight from my bum, and like just coming out. And it's, uh,
Yeah it's just uh not, not been very pleasant. And like I just, it just kind of hasn't, doesn't feel like it's getting better. So
Wow, no. Sorry to hear. Seems like there's a lot going on there. Well, when did it all start, your symptoms?
Um, so I think it was a few, when I think about it
So Monday, Tuesday, I I, so I think it was about three, it's been about three days now.
OK. And is it mainly diarrhoea? So, you mentioned watery stools. Um
How many times are you going a day, would you say?
Um so I , I feel like it's like almost every hour, when I'm awake.
Um, so . Sorry?
Alright, wow. OK. So you're losing a lot of, a lot of, you're using a lot of fluid there.
Yeah, so I mean I'm , I'm trying to drink a lot of water.
But um, yeah it's just quite a lot and
Uh it's, yeah I I, I think I I feel like it's just, just fluids coming out.
OK. Have you got any blood in your stools?
Um
So I, no I don't, I don't remember anything, like, no I , I think it's just I, nothing like that. There's nothing like that.
OK. And any, any tummy pain? Any, any, any pain in your tummy?
Yeah. I mean I, it, I feel, I feel a cramp.
and then, and then I know it's time to go right? So, around every hour I just feel something come up. And then I have to go. So, yeah I mean that's, that's the , kind of the first sign.

Where is this crampy pain? Which part of your tummy?
It's kind of, . If I think about it, it's like, it's like at the bottom. Uh, I don't know if that makes sense. Um
. Well why don't we start with, is it, is it in the middle, or is it to one particular side?
Um I I think it it , it feels pretty , like in the middle, to me. Not on any side, left or right.
OK. And does the pain come and go, or is it there constantly?
Um, it it comes and goes. It comes and goes.
. Fine, OK. And if I was to ask you on a scale of one to ten, ten being the worst pain you ever had, how bad is this pain?
OK so like
Um

So
What do you mean by, uh pain? So I, I think it's maybe a
Is it, is this pain as in making you double over? Is it ten, is it ten out of ten, the worst pain you ever had? Or is it more of a kind of a mild pain, like a three out of ten?
I I guess so. I'm, when I think about it, like when I get it, I can pretend that I don't feel it. So I can still sit down and
Uh I can still like cover it up, and people don't really notice. So I, I don't know what that means. But maybe is that like a six, or a seven?
solid six. OK, OK. Alright, good. Um, and apart from the pain and diarrhea, any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting?
OK.
Um, yeah I definitely, I definitely feel kind of nauseous. Um
Like I and, like I've have vomited. And when I like, I think it's maybe something to do with like, whenever I have like milk or something like that, I just feel like I want to vomit. And actually, yeah one time I just like had some milk, and I just completely vomited it.
Not sleeping. OK, alright. Uh
Um, I've been, I've been trying to avoid it. But um, yeah.
And the vomiting is not as pronounced as the diarrhea. Is that right?
Um, sorry could you repeat that?
and the vomiting is not as, uh, prominent as the diarrhea. Is that right?
Uh no, no it's not.
OK. OK, alright. Um, any other symptoms, like fevers or temperatures?
Um so I, yeah I think I am pretty, I feel kind of really hot all the time. And uh I'm pretty sure I'm burning up. I haven't actually done any temperature reading, or anything like that. But it's, I, yeah I've, I've sure I'm, I'm not a, like not a normal temperature.
OK.
OK, so you're feeling hoarse. OK. And in terms of your waterworks, are you passing urine OK?
Um yeah a bit, I guess less frequently maybe. Um but yeah, it seems to be OK.
OK, alright. Um, fine. And, and you said that, you mentioned, three days ago was when it all kicked off. Are you aware of any triggers? I mean, have you for example gone out, had some takeaway food? Have you been around anyone else, um with diarrhea, for example?
Um so I , so my um my brother has had, actually had something like this for um he has it as well for five days, as well. Um and I I've, I'm not, yeah I I can't think of what, what the trigger is for me. I mean, my brother normally can deal, deals with this stuff a lot better than me. But , yeah I, that's why
Is your, is your brother now better?
Um
He, so he's been like this for five days. I think he's getting better, but I'm not, I'm not really sure. He said, he said he had, he's had something for a little while as well.
OK, alright. Are you having anything to eat or drink? Have you, I can see you're drinking a coffee, but are you keeping it down? Are you keeping your fluids down?
Um so it just feels like the, the fluids do go down. But it just feels like it's going straight through.
It just feels like it's going straight through.
OK, alright. Fine. When was the last time you had anything solid to eat? And which , which uh which you kept in?
Um so, I had some, I mean I had some lunch today. Um
But again it just it just came, come out pretty loose.
OK, alright. Um and and Dan, moving forwards, are you otherwise fit and well, or do you have any other medical history?
Um, so I um, yeah I think, I think otherwise I'm fit and well. I um
Yeah I mean I, I'm an OK weight. And um, I I can't think of any related medical history.
Um, I mean like my, yeah I no I I don't think so.
Good.
I'll take it you don't take any regular medications, then.
So I
Um
No I mean I, I've been taking some like Paracetamols and stuff like that lately. But uh, I haven't been, I'm not on any regular medication or anything like that.
OK. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
Um, so I don't have any allergies that I know of.
OK. And what about any family history? Do you have any family history of bowel problems?
Um bowel, so would, would bowel like, is is the colon like something that
Yeah, yeah. So what I mean by bowel is the whole gut. So it could be anything from the mouth anus.
So my, yeah my, my dad actually has um colon cancer at the moment.
Ohh dear. I'm very sorry to hear that. How is he?
So um, from what I heard he's kind of, So I don't I don't speak to him that often. So I don't, I don't know the exact details. And I, I don't exactly know the full things of like the steps of cancer, and all that kind of thing. But um, he's sort of in his third stage. Uh, I'm not sure what that means exactly.

Um, and yeah. So yeah it's, it's um, he's, yeah you can, yeah I can see he's kind of weaker, and it's affecting him a lot. And um, that's it's quite, I I guess he's um, had it for a little while now.
Yeah, OK.

Yeah I'll make a not of that 'cause uh, important to know these kind of details. Um, and socially, tell me more about your home situation. Who's at home with you, Dan?
Um so, uh not my brother. He doesn't live with me. I'm, I live with my, um sister and my mum.
OK. And, uh, how are things at home?
Um, I think, I mean in what sense do you mean that?
Don't .
in general day-to-day life are you managing OK? Any particular ?

I mean uh
I think uh, yeah it's been, it's been tricky. Um
Going to work with all of this. Um I dislike um, taking time off work. I feel like I I just want to go, um when I can. So I I try and go um
I think at, at home, uh yeah I just haven't really um
I I don't normally actually um, eat with my family. I normally am buying stuff and that kind of thing. So, I don't think it's affected them. And I haven't really been, haven't really gone into detail with my sister and my mom about it. Um
Yeah. I'd, I'd just rather deal with these things. Um so
Sure. you mentioned work. You mentioned work. What is it you do for work?
Um
So I work at a, I I work at um an office, um in Central London. Um it's uh, so I work in government.
, OK. So , OK right. And just a couple last final couple, uh couple questions. Uh, smoking and alcohol, do you do either? Do you smoke, or do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
Um so I I smoke um, I smoke uh, uh for like socially, but not like regularly. Um
So normally if if it's a, a Friday or something like that I might, I might have a cigarette or something like that. But um not .

Sorry?
And alcohol?
So alcohol, um uh you know I might have a a beer during the weekdays, maybe uh not that many, maybe um . On Fridays I have more um alcohol um

But not .
But yeah uh, I'll have my units um

Uh, honest, I suppose um, not every week, but maybe I'll once or twice a month, that yeah, I'll go out with my friends and drink a lot so that that's um, yeah um

Well thank you for me. That's really helpful to know. So um, Dan, just as a a conclusion, uh um, just to wrap it all up, I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis.
OK.
bit of a basic infection of your tummy. . There's nothing to worry about. Uh um uh uh I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days.
OK.
Just like you did for you brother. Drink, make sure you drink plenty of fluids, OK? And you can
Uh-huh.
Should I just drink like normal water? I just feel like every time I drink it's just coming out. Um
Right.
fluid is probably best. But I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins. Um so, you can get things like Diarolyte, which is um, a fluid replacement you can get from the pharmacy. It's probably worth uh recommending that.
Do i need like a prescription for that?
no, you can just get that over the counter.
OK.
Um, you can try just you know regular Paracetamol if you are feeling feverish. But if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days, so forty eight hours, I want you to give me a call back.

Because um, you know if you are getting dehydrated then we need to do further investigations, OK? But I think let's, let's see how you are in the next one to two days.
OK.
And uh, we'll catch up soon, OK?
OK. So you're saying that I should, I could, uh I'll try and buy this Dioralyte. What, what should I do in terms of um, food and that kind of thing? Should I just focus on fluids?
clear fluids. You can use soft diet, things like soup, mash. And then gradually build up, um as much as your body can tolerate.
Um, but let's try and keep yourself well-hydrated first, OK?
OK. Is it OK for me to carry on having like, um Paracetamol and things like that?
Absolutely. If you are having, if you've got a bit of tummy pain, if you're feeling feverish, then I think Paracetamol is very sensible.
OK.
OK? Try and avoid alcohol if you can.
Uh, OK I'll try. Yeah.
OK. Alright then.
OK.
Thank you for your help.
Alright. Thank you very much. Thanks, thanks for helping me out.
. Thank you. Bye bye now.

**Patient Name**: Dan Choudhry  
**Age**: 27  
**Date of Discharge**: [Insert Date]  

---

**Hospital Course**  
The patient, a 27-year-old male, presented with a three-day history of acute gastroenteritis. Symptoms included frequent, watery diarrhea (approximately every hour while awake), crampy abdominal pain (rated 6/10, localized to the mid-abdomen, intermittent), nausea, and vomiting. He reported vomiting after consuming dairy, with no blood in stools. He described a feverish sensation without measured temperature, and noted dehydration despite increased fluid intake.  

The patient’s brother also had a similar illness lasting five days, with gradual improvement. The patient denied prior medical history, allergies, or regular medications, though he admitted to occasional paracetamol use for mild symptoms. A family history of colon cancer (father, stage III) was noted.  

Social history revealed he lives with his mother and sister, but does not engage in regular meals with them. He works in a government office in Central London and has been attempting to maintain work attendance despite symptoms.  

---

**Discharge Diagnosis**  
Acute gastroenteritis, likely viral in origin, with secondary dehydration.  

---

"[doctor] hi virginia how are you today what brings you in
[patient] i'm doing alright i started seeing this new pcp last year and you know she has been doing a lot of changes to my medication and making sure everything is up to date and she my noticed that my blood pressure has been quite high so she added to medications but and but i you know i've been taking them i've been really good and i i before i was n't but now i am and we're still having a hard time controlling my blood pressure so she thought it would be a good idea for me to see you especially since she noted some on my last blood work she said something about my kidneys
[doctor] okay yeah so okay let's before i dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling
[patient] i would say you know most of the days i feel fine i'm still busy at work i definitely can tell though when my blood pressure is high
[doctor] okay you measure it at home you you you measure your blood pressure at home
[patient] yeah i she wanted me to get a blood pressure cuff so i did start getting checking my blood pressures probably like a few times a week
[doctor] okay
[patient] and so then i noticed that it has been getting higher the other day was even as high as one seventy over ninety
[doctor] wow
[patient] so i did call my pcp and she increased the meds again
[doctor] yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home
[patient] yeah she i have a a electronic one an electronic arm one
[doctor] okay okay yeah that's good that's good and have you ever tried do you go to cvs at all
[patient] yeah i i do but i've noticed like since the pandemic i do n't see the blood pressures anymore
[doctor] okay okay yeah i i thought the one down on main street they i thought they just brought that one back so
[patient] did they
[doctor] yeah
[patient] that's good to know
[doctor] you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally
[patient] alright do you want the honest answer
[doctor] well yeah that would be better
[patient] so i really you know with everything going on i really been trying to get better but i mean during football season it's really difficult i really love watching my games so have a lot of pizza wings subs like i said i've been trying to cut down especially on days where there is no games but it probably could be better
[doctor] okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches
[patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis
[doctor] okay what about chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] shortness of breath
[patient] no shortness of breath
[doctor] even with exertion
[patient] even with exertion
[doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed
[patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no
[doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure
[patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease
[doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on
[patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on
[doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve
[patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday
[doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for
[patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends
[doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me
[patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control
[doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan
[patient] that sounds good thank you

"Hi.
Hi there. It's Doctor Smith from Babylon.
Hi Doctor Smith. Hi, can you confirm your name, date of birth, and your home address please?
Hi Doctor Smith.
Yes. My name is Mary Jo. Date of birth is January first, nineteen eighty.

And my address is uh, sixty Sloane Avenue, London.
OK, I, are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today?
Absolutely.
What can I do for you?
So, a couple of things. I, I, think I may have, overdone my workouts, and now my knees are hurting, and they're clicking a lot, and it's starting to worry me.
Um, I can't run very far, um, any more without just feeling, pain in my knees.
And then, sometimes I also get this weird tingling in my toes. Um.
So yeah, that's, that's it. I'm just concerned and I figured you know I'd call and, see if you can, help me figure out what's going on.
OK, that's fine. So when do you think it started?
So probably, it's been about two weeks.
OK. Um, and, any joint problems before that?
You know not, not really. I mean I play a lot of sports. Um, and I had a , like I play some ice hockey, and I had this injury a few months ago.
You know I just like, fell on the ice and, and, you know had a, huge bruise but, I think that's about it.
OK, So, um, at the moment, just tell me about the exercise that you're doing, normally.
So I'm training, well, I'm currently training for a marathon, um, that's gonna happen in, June. And so, I'm trying to run like.
I mean right now, I'm actually not even doing such long runs, maybe like seven or eight miles. And so, I started about uh, maybe a month ago.

Uh, I've done like, you know, four or five miles, and I've just done like a couple of seven, mile runs.
And then uh, uh, and then you know I go to the gym like few times a week and, kinda do my, usual routine.

Um, but, yeah, I think the only thing that's really different has, have been, the runs, the longer runs.
And, have you had, any times when the knee feels like it's giving way underneath you?
Um, well, I, what do you mean by that? I'm not sure what, what that means.
So, it means if you're, if you're there and uh, you just feel it sort of jolt, like give way, feel unstable underneath you.
Not, not bad, I mean it just kinda starts hurting, you know. Um.
And does it hurt, uh, how far into the run does it generally hurt?
You know I would say probably starts off like after, uh, maybe, twenty minutes or so. Which is, probably I don't know like somewhere around mile, three maybe, two and a half or three miles.
OK. Ooh you're fast. Um.
switching my kilometres and miles, I'm not sure, all right.
Um. And, um, do you have to stop running, or can you run through the pain?
Yeah, that is a good question. So, um, you know the last few times, the last time I actually stopped, I mean I ran a little bit longer, but then I stopped, because it was um, I, I feel like it's getting worse.
OK.
Um, and, when I start doing my abs, that's, you know when I do my abs. It's kind of requiring me to move my you know, um, to kind of go from the flex position on my knees, and straighten my legs, then I feel all this clicking.
OK.
And, I think that's also freaked me out, and uh, I just figured you know, something's wrong here.
Right. And, you said before, it's both knees.
So it's more, um, it's actually my right knee that hurts.

And, any problems with your left one?
No.
OK, and, can you just describe in the knee, or show me whereabouts the pain, is happening mainly?
So, ah, you know I, I feel it, it's kind of weird, I feel it in the middle, but I almost feel like maybe it kind of uh, um, moves to the right, to the right of my knee a little bit.
OK. Have you noticed any tenderness when you press over any areas in the knee?
So, yes, well it's, I have, probably some fluid. I googled it, and you know it says that sometimes fluid accumulates uh, I.
OK. , does it look swollen to you?
Sorry?
Does the knee look swollen?
Um, well it did, like, the first time I ran, it was a little bit swollen, but then I just put some like ice on it, and it went away.

Um, but, right now, right now it's not swollen, and right now it doesn't hurt, you know.
Um, but, it just kind of comes on when uh, um, or you know right now when I flex and extend my leg, it, there's no clicking but, I'll notice it in the gym and then, you know, when I run it'll start hurting.
OK, and, if you're sitting, still for a while, do you have any problems when you stand up, any locking up of the knee?
No.
Can't straighten it. Any problems going up and down stairs?
No.
Any problems just walking normally?
No, none, I don't.
And intervals of range of movement. Are you able to fully straighten the leg?
Yes.
And what about fully flex it?
Yes.
OK. Are you taking any medication for the knee?
Well, um, since you're asking. Um, yes I , I take Ibuprofen, um, and I'll just kinda, use it sometime like uh, um, like sometimes I have some joint issues, but you know, that kind of, is not very frequent. So I'll take Ibuprofen for that.
But you know it's nothing like major maybe, like, four hundred milligrams max, something like that.
I also sometimes will um, you know, smoke a joint.
Um, and, yeah, other than that, that's it.
OK, and any other joint problems, that you're getting? Any back pains? Small swelling of your, hands, feet, elbows, wrists? Any pain?
No.
Uh, well I have sometimes, you know how sometimes like if you stand for a long time, your feet will kinda, or your legs will swell up. Like I noticed it because of my socks, I'll just kind of, notice this indentation.
OK.
And then, another weird thing. I've felt this just once, but there was this tingling in my toes, like uh, um, after the run.
There was tingling in my toes like on my, you know my right toes, um, so.
On your right side.
Yes.
Any change in colour, or temperature of your lower legs?
No.
Any swelling which stays if you push in, and then you release it, that it stays there?
Well I don't know if I really try that, but I, I will tell you that, what I noticed is like if I, you know when my socks come off, I kind of notice that indentation a little bit, I mean it's not like major, right but, I. Uh, I mean do you mean I just need to like press and see what happens, if it like kind of stays or, .
Yeah, any, or any pain in the back of the calf or anything like that?
No, no, nothing like that, no.
Um, and, with your foot, has that gone back to normal now? Do you feel any altered senstation, tingling numbness, anything like that?
No it was just, it was that time, uh, but it was just really weird, because it kind of went on for a while.
OK.And any pain in the joints of your foot or , on the underside in the arch? Any problems walking round on hard floors?
No.
No.
OK, have you had, any other medical problems before?
Uh, well, I had uh.
You know what just, kind of your garden variety stuff, right, colds and, uh. I mean I, I do have, I'm far-sighted, and so I had uh, I had Lasik surgery.
And then, once I had this really bad UTI, they thought it was kidney stones, and so they had me actually in ER.
And if my GP didn't call them, tell them, that you know, they don't need to give me Morphine.
Um, that was kind of an awful experience but, uh, other than that, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm pretty good.

OK, and, do you take any other medications, apart from the ones you told me about?
Well, I'll take uh, I take vitamin D.
Uh, I take melatonin. Sometimes, you know, just for cramps, I'll take, like, uh, um, ibuprofen, or actually , uh, I'll take, what am I taking? Aleve. Whatever Aleve is.
Think that's maybe um, Acetaminophen, or, I can't remember what class of drugs.
You know occasionally, if I'm really having hard times, like I'll, I'll sleeping, I'll take Xanax.
Um, but, I prefer Melatonin, it's just sometimes Melatonin doesn't work.
OK. And, any problems with your stomach, or asthma, indigestion, acid reflux?
No, no, no problems.
. And, what I would suggest is, definitely carrying on with the ice therapy that you've been using. So, as much as you can, 'cause that really does make a difference to injuries.
Brings the healing blood into the area, and it gives it the best chance of, getting better. So, as much as you can, use the ice.
Mm-hmm.
Um, obviously you're trying to stick to a marathon programme, but.
Um, I would, try and ease up on the running, if you can. And if it, if it's painful enough that you're, having to stop running, then it's not a good idea, to do that.
Um. It's fine to take the Ibuprofen. Um, I can prescribe you a slightly stronger, anti-inflammatory that you can take regularly instead of the Ibuprofen, but not with the Ibuprofen.
Hmm.
But make sure that with food. Ultimately we probably need to, examine the knee.
I see.
Um, so, the best thing I would, suggest, getting a appointment with the physiotherapist first, who can do like a long, assessment, and examination of the knee.
And then we can make an assessment as to whether we need to do any, um, imagery to , have a look inside the knee, and see if there's any problem with the, cartilage.
OK.
Well, you know I read, I read some stuff online that, that maybe like my ligaments there's, I think it's like ACL or, or something like that right, and so if that. I mean I'm kind of like freaked out that that may break.
So do you think it's that, or?
Um, it's, it's not really possible to, diagnose that over the , over the video. So we definitely would need to, see you. And, the, a physio is the best point of call, because they'll probably be the most likely initial treatment.
Right.
But certainly if the appointment time's too long to wait, then we can see, we can see you in our clinic as well.
OK.
OK.
Can you, so are you going to send referral for that?
Yep, we can, we can do a referral before that. If in the meantime you develop like persistant swelling, heat, redness, um, of the knee, or high temperature, feel unwell, or it completely locks up and you can't bend and stretch it.
OK. Great.
Then, you'd need to see a doctor urgently, so call us back in that, case. .
Mm-hmm.
That sounds good. Thank you yeah. , sure I mean, give me the, stronger medicine, I'll give that a try.
OK. I'll send it through to your pharmacy for you. OK? Thank you, bye.
OK. Sweet. Thanks so much. OK. Bye, bye.","**Clinical Note**

"Hello. Good afternoon.
Hiya.
Hi there. This is Doctor , from GP at Hand.
Hi there. My name's Atan.
Hi Anthony. So, could I have your um, before we start, could I have your full name and date of birth? If that's possible?
Sure. So, it's Ayrton Warren. Um, and my date of birth, is the sixteenth of May, nineteen, eighty two.
That's , thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're OK to speak?
I am, yes.
OK, great. So how can I help you today?
Um, so I kind of woke up this morning, um, and I've just got this, really horrible pain on the left side of my head. Um, a real kind of headachy feeling.
Sure, OK. And, um, uh, , did the, did the pain wake you up?
Yeah, it woke me up, um, quite early this morning.
What, what time did it wake you up?
Um, probably around, five thirty ish.
And, what time do you normally get up?
Um, I normally get up at about, seven o'clock.
Is the headache still present now?
Yes, it is.
OK. Have you had this kind of pain before?
Um, I mean uh, I've, had a bit of a history with headaches, but nothing as severe as this before.
So they were less severe. Were they similar in nature in terms of being one-sided and the type of pain?
Um, not so much on the one side, it tends to be, a bit of a cluster at the front of my head in a way. Um, but this time it's just kind of more prominent on the left side which, I've never really had it, normally they kind of spread across the front of my head.
OK, all right. And, um, can I just double-check, do you have any neck stiffness at all?
Uh, no.
OK. And do you have any fever?
No.
All right. Um, how are you with bright lights at the moment? Do you feel sensitive to bright lights or can you, can you tolerate them all right, OK?
Um, it, I'm a little bit sensitive it just, it kind of, makes my eyes a little bit sore, but nothing that I can't really handle.
OK. And, can I just double-check, um, are you feeling nauseous at all?
Um, not really, like . When I first got up this morning, my head felt a bit dizzy, but that's kind of subsided now, and I, seems to, be fine.
OK. Um, and um, can I just double-check, does anyone in your family have any migraines or anything like that? They've been diagnosed with migraines?
Uh, no. They haven't.
OK. Um, and um, are you under any particular stress at the moment?
Um, work's kind of, um, a bit stressful at the moment. I've got a lot going on.
Um, yeah, I just seem to have like, a lot of, kind of, a backlog of work that I need to go through at the moment. So, I've kind of, been, doing a lot of late nights as well.
Right, OK. Um, and, um, how long has that been the case for?
Uh, for probably about a couple of months now.
, how would you say your mood is?
Um, I'm not, like moody, I'm not angry or, um, like I get a bit frustrated during the day. Um, but , it kind of, um, ebbs and flows every now and then, but, yeah.
OK. Do you have, have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety, or depression or stress in the past?
Um, I've had, um, so I had, like anxiety for about, two years now, and I've been on, uh, Sertraline for, a while.
OK. Are you taking Sertraline at the moment?
Yes.
OK. Um, and how do you feel in terms of , anxiety at the moment? Do you feel anxious at the moment?
, no, not necessarily at work, sometimes I do feel a bit anxious. Um, but I, I kind of just, uh, the panic of not being able to get my work done on time.

Um, but other than that, I, I don't, feel, um, massively anxious.
OK, all right. Um, now, sorry to ask this, just need to ask this for , anyone suffering from anxiety. Do you have any , have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or hurting yourself?
No.
Good, I'm glad to hear that. Um, now, with regards to this headache. Is it worse when you lie down, or um, is, is, is it better when you lie down?
Um, when I lay down, like, uh, it kind of feels a little bit sore at first, um and it takes me a while to get comfortable. Um, so yeah, at the beginning it does, but then again that's just kind of, um, soothes a little bit.
OK.
Um, so, would you say ultimately, it's better when you lie down? Or have you not ?
Uh, yeah, I would say so.
OK. Um, and um, in terms of um, this, headache since this morning, have you taken anything for it yet?
Um, I've taken some Paracetamol.
Has that helped?
Um, not really, no.
OK. Taking anything else at all?
No that's it, just Paracetamol.
OK. Um, do you have any other illnesses at all?
Uh, none.
Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure?
No.
Have you ever had your blood pressure checked?
No.
OK. Um, and are there any illnesses in your family?
Um, no, there's nothing. My parents, uh, my mum's had a history of anxiety as well but, no kind of like physical illnesses or anything like that.
OK, all right. And um, are you on any medication?
Um, no, other, other than Sertraline and having taken, um, Paracetamol this morning, uh, nothing else.
Do you have any allergies to any medication?
Not that I'm aware of, no.
All right. And, are you living by yourself at the moment, or living with someone else?
Um, I live with my partner.
OK. Are you a smoker?
No.
OK. And, uh, do you have any pets at home?
Uh, I have a cat.
OK. And, can I just double-check, how much exercise would you do normally a week?
Um, so normally I, try to go running at least three times a week.
OK.
And what's your diet like?
Um, it's OK, um, it's nothing, it's nothing um, really healthy, um, but it's fine.
OK.
I wouldn't say unhealthy.
All right. Um, now um, in terms of this headache, uh, obviously I haven't been able to examine you, or see you directly.
But, um, it sounds like it might be one of two things. It could be an element of what we call tension headache.
Sure.
OK. That's one possibility. Um, and what makes that, more likely is the fact that, you've been under some pressure, and you have a history of anxiety in the past, OK. Um.
OK.
The other possibility is, um, migraine as well.
OK. Um, and, the fact, what makes that more likely is the fact that it's on one side, and that you've got some sensitivity to light.
OK.
OK, So, what, what I think we can do, is um, I think we can give you some, um, generic, pain relief.
OK.
That would be the appropriate first step, for, migraine type headaches. OK. So I'll tell you what it is in a second.
OK.
And the other thing that I was gonna suggest is, we maybe look, explore things to try and decrease the stress from work.
So, um, the medication-wise, the things that we'd start off first line, if someone had migraine was to, would be to start Ibuprofen.
OK.
And um, uh, that, the doses of Ibuprofen can be a bit, more than the normal doses Ibuprofen so that's one thing we can start. You can keep on taking Paracetamol as well if you like, but the, the Ibuprofen's um, actually more effective , for migraine.
OK.
And, um, yeah, so the, the guidelines have changed, recently we used, we, before that we used to give Paracetamol as first line but now it's, um, Ibuprofen or Aspirin.
Ohh right, O.
That's, thing. Um, the other thing I'd like you to do, is maybe consider taking some time off work. OK, because if the headache is due to stress from work.
OK.
OK.
Um, maybe having a week off if you self-certify, that might help with things. And I'd also like you to explore, counselling options as well so there's, a counselling service in your area, that I can give you the link for, for you to self-refer.

I'd like you to, , OK I'd like you to try that. Um, what, we're gonna do is, we'll have a follow-up in a week's time.
Yeah, that'd be.
As well as those two things, other things I'd like you to do, is to try and ensure that you're having a minimum of seven, eight hours sleep at night, every night. And you're drinking a minimum of, um, one point five to two litres uh, of water or fluids a day, and that's not including coffee or tea.
OK.
OK.
All right, because sometimes dehydration and you know uh, fatigue can be causes of headaches as well. Um.
Ohh OK, I didn't realise that.
Yeah, so it, that, that, that is um, you know, we need to rule those things out. Um, let's, let's try that.
OK. Um, and let's have a follow-up appointment, if we're finding that things are not getting better, we might need to arrange some blood tests or um, look at uh, other possibilities, but, we'll try that in the first instance.
Um, if anything changes in the meantime, or you get worried or things get worse. Feel free, have a lower threshold for ringing us back and we can book you an appointment, and we can reassess the situation.
OK. Yeah, the, that, that sounds brilliant. Thank you so much for your help.
OK, no problem. So there'll be a summary of all of this in the notes. Um, and I'll also leave a link, to some of the danger signs of symptoms of headaches, in the notes. If you can read through that in your own time, that will just help you to have a bit more, control over what's going on and understanding of what, what, what kind of things, should trigger you contacting another doctor.
OK. That's perfect. Thank you so much for your help.
No problem, OK. So we'll, we'll touch base in a week's time, with me or, myself or one of the other doctors, and we , we'll take it from there, OK.
OK. Thank you. Yeah, I'll book an appointment, in, um, yeah, in that time.
Brilliant, OK then, all right. Take care then, all the best.
Bye.
Thank you, and you.
Bye bye.
Bye.","**SBAR Handoff Note**

[doctor] okay and when you mention drinking and eating is do you feel like anything is getting stuck there
[patient] no i do n't feel like anything is getting stuck right now and i have n't been i have been eating but not as much as i normally would
[doctor] okay okay alright and how are you doing as far as like just emotionally and mentally how are you doing i'm just talking a little bit about your support systems
[patient] the nursing staff and the office has been very good to help you know with anything that i need as far as support so just since we are just getting started so far on the journey i do feel like i have support and mentally you know still feel strong
[doctor] okay and how about with family or friends have you been able to turn to anyone
[patient] i do have good family members that have been supportive and they have come to my treatment with me
[doctor] okay excellent excellent and so right now you're on a combination of two different chemotherapies the cisplestan as well as the eupside and you had your last treatment just a few days ago but you're saying right now you've been able to tolerate the nausea and the fatigue
[patient] yes i have n't had any nausea but you know just slight fatigue it does n't seem to be overwhelming
[doctor] okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far
[patient] that sounds great thank you
[doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss
[patient] great

Because even at work I, I can, when I'm in a meeting and I have to, like uh think about my work, I can't focus, I can't actually focus on my work. It's really annoying because I can't actually think about, uh, what I have to say. I'm always like, uh, disturbed by this disease.
Yeah.

No no, OK. I'm certain this is obviously affecting you. And uh we'll try our very best to get get this sorted out for you. Um, have you had anything like this before in the past?
Um so yes. Uh earlier I was like prescribed for my eczema.
OK.
And they gave me like some cream, and something to, uh when I like shower, when I was in the shower, had to put something. But um
OK.
Did it help?
Um I mean, at that time yes. That's, those symptoms, like these symptoms appear like, when the symptoms appeared again, I tried those and it didn't work.
I've tried a few things. Like I bought a, a steroid cream at the pharmacy last night. But it apparently didn't help, because it's still itching a lot today. Uh, yeah.
OK.
OK.
Do you remember the name of the cream you bought?
A steroid cream.
OK, steroid, OK. um would you say these symptoms are very similar to your eczema symptoms, or different?
Um
it's much more like itchy. And my eczema was more like only in the arm. But now it's also on the chest. And in the on the, on the hands as well.
OK.
Like pretty, yeah when, like I like, for instance hiking, during the weekend. And

I am, I can't really do it anymore, because it's like very like I wanted to do that last weekend. And because super painful, and I I have to take like showers every day to be able to, cannot uh ease this itching part, which is very very annoying.
Yes.
No. Well OK. That's so you mentioned the itchiness. Um you also mentioned it's been quite sore.
Yeah.
Um have you, have you noticed any uh bleeding or discharge from your skins?
. OK.
No. Um so my skin is a bit cracked in some parts, like kind of cracked, if you see what I mean. But uh, yeah.
OK.
You've not, haven't uh seen any other uh pus or blood, coming out of your skin.
No.
No. And you mentioned it all started three days ago.
Are you, four days ago. Are you aware of any triggers, or anything that you may have done, that may have caused your symptoms to start?
Four days ago.
So for example, have you changed your uh shower gel, any clothing?
Have you been around anyone else?
No I . It's actually like, it's really annoying, because I'm thinking about, maybe I should change something. Because I I haven't, and I don't understand I cannot, um afraid of asking people around me because it's cannot you know um, I don't feel really comfortable asking about these questions. It's kind of intimate that. So I your help now.
Mm.
Mm. No no, OK. That's OK. Um
Fine, so just to resummarize. For the last four days, you've had very itchy skin, very sore skin all over your body, mainly your chest. And did you also mention your arms and legs as well?
Yeah.
Uh, no. Just the chest, hands and like, like inside the elbows. Yeah.

OK. anything on your face at all?
Am I what?
On your face?
On my face? No.
No, OK. And apart from this, any other symptoms have you noticed? For example, have you noticed any temperature or fevers?
No. just very itchy. Nothing else.
Itchy. OK. So your, your bowels are working OK?
Your chest is OK? No cough, no breathing difficulties?
No.
You're passing urine OK.
I I think so.
OK, alright. Um
It's always good to know. So, I mean, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms?
Any what?
Any ideas, as to what could be causing your symptoms?
Um so I had eczema before. So maybe it's disease, but it seems like more uh, like uh my eczema was only on the arms. So, I'm I'm not sure. I I really have no idea.

OK. That's OK. So um, normally at this stage I like to examine you. Um
To see the rash itself, to see exactly what type of rash it is. But from what you've told me, you mentioned it's, you've got some dry skin and some, uh cracked skin as well.
Uh and has been very itchy. And so would your um
Yeah.
Uh your your background of eczema. Um
So
Sorry to say, there's a couple of questions I wanted to ask you, which I completely forgot, my apologies. Um, apart from the eczema, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of?
Uh, no. I just had asthma in the past. But not anymore.
OK. Not anymore, OK. And do you take any regular medications at the moment?
Uh no.
No, OK. Do you have any allergies to anything?
I like some , sorry? Yeah?
sorry I said do you have any allergies to anything?

Hello?
Hello? Yes.
can you hear me? That's alright I think it . Uh do you have any allergies at all?
Ohh, allergies. Uh, no.
No, OK. Um and tell me about your um uh your situation at home. Who do you live with?
Uh so, I live with a few flatmates. I'm a, so you know I'm thirty one. Uh I, yeah I'm I have a full time job. And so I'm living with a few people to save money.
OK. And what do you do for work?
Uh I work uh at a pharmaceutical company.
So it's been a, it's been a few years now. Uh it's uh, it's kind of interesting. We're working I'm a, like a kind of project manager. Uh I mean, do you want to, to know more about it?
OK. Uh no no no that's , that's absolutely fine. Um just a couple of questions I want to ask you, which can sometimes affect your symptoms, is, do you smoke at all?
No.
No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol?

Uh you know, once in a while I can, I like hanging out with people once in a while. So yeah I'd say a few, a few beers per week. Something like this. Nothing, nothing crazy. I used to drink a lot more when I was younger. But it's been, it's been a while.
OK. OK. OK I've got to say, at this stage I've got to say this sound quality is not uh great. But I will continue because we've come this far. Um
So um, based on everything you mentioned Sarah , I do wonder whether this is a flare-up of your eczema. Um

The reason being that you said it was quite itchy. Um it's mainly affecting your chest and your back.
Um and uh, having looked at your skin, uh the the the rash does appear quite familiar. Um you mentioned using steroid creams, yesterday.

Um from the pharmacy. I wonder whether giving you a stronger prescription of a of a steroid may be beneficial.
Uh, which I'm happy to prescribe to you today. As well as, I'm going to give you something, some emollients, which helps to moisturize the skin.
OK.
OK.
Um which use in the bath and shower. And it's definitely worth um using that for the first seven to ten days.
OK.
Uh before we make the decision on whether it's working or not.
OK.
Um it's also worth um using antihistamines, which you can sometimes buy over counter.
Things like Loratadine or Piriton, which can help the itchiness of your skin.
OK.
And uh, um it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms, anything you wear or anything you use, in terms of shower gels or soap.
Because if that's causing your symptoms, then we need to have a discussion about an eczema CU.
OK. Yes, I have tried antihistamines, uh lately, but it didn't really help.
Ohh, could you say that again, sorry?
I have tried uh antihistamines, but uh but it didn't really help.
OK.
OK. So it's something for you to think about. you can get different types of antihistamines. I can give you something a little bit stronger today as well.
Um, something like Fexofenadine, which I can give to you today. It's definitely worth trying, and it's not going to do you any harm.
OK.
Um but I think using the steroids and the emollients, um on a regular basis
Uh over the next week to ten days, should hopefully control your symptoms. But do come back and see me next week, if things don't get better.
That sounds good.
OK? Um do you have any questions for me?
Uh, no that's it. Thank you very much. Bye. Thank you as well. Bye.
OK. Well I wish you all the best.
Thank you. Have a good day.","**Clinical Note**

Thank you.
OK. So you've mentioned in in our notes that you've got some tightness. If you'd like to tell me a bit more about it please.
Yeah about two to three days ago, I was running with a friend. And usually I can talk to her whilst I run, but I found myself actually short of breath. I'm not really sure of that when I'm walking. Um, but definitely um, if I'm walking briskly now. Um, and I've used my blue inhaler but to no avail. It hasn't really helped me.
. OK.
Um, ohh yeah, so I'm having, I'm just wheezing a bit, and coughing and just generally a bit short of breath
Wheezing and coughing, OK. And you've mentioned you're using the blue inhaler. So, how often are you using the blue inhaler?
Um, I think I'm just using that as and when I have symptoms.
Yeah. So, um, at the moment you are having shortness of breath. So, are you using it every day at the moment?
Um, yeah, and morning or evening to kinda prevent it as well.
OK, and um what, which colour? What's the name of your preventor?
Um, it's blue. Um, I think, in totality, I'm Salbutamol, Flanel Bactroban and Hydrocortisone that I'm taking as well.
Yeah.
OK. So could you repeat that?
Er, Cetraben and Hydrocortisone.
And hydrocortisone. So you'd have eczema also, yeah?
What's that, sorry?
You do have a history of eczema, ?
Em, my brother is asthmatic and my sister has eczema. Em, and I've got a few issues, um, that I think could be eczema as well.
OK, right. So coming back to your, um, you know your shortness of breath. You've mentioned you're wheezy, and you're coughing. Are you bringing up any phlegm at all?
Um, no I don't, um, I'm not covering up much .
OK, no sputum, OK.
Right . And um, how are you using your, um, your ? So are you using it every day?
Um, I think I'm using that every day and the Salbutamol just like as and when
So, how are you using the ? Is it twice a day?
Um, yes
twice
OK. And have you ever been admitted in hospital because your was so bad?
Um, no, I haven't.
OK.
Righty-ho. When was the last time you had an asthma attack?
Um, about three to four years ago.
Three to four years ago. And what, what did the GP do at that time?
Um, just, um, encourage me to carry on using my inhalers as a preventative.
OK. So you didn't have any oral steroids or antibiotics?
Not that I can remember.
OK. Um, OK. Right, have you ever had oral steroids in the past?
Um, no.
When was the last time you had an asthma review with our nurse?
Uh, about two years ago.
OK. Two years ago.
OK. But, your asthma was pretty under control till, till now, isn't it?
Uh, yes, just in the last two to three days .
Yes. So do you do a peak flow meter at home? Peak flow reading? Where you blow into, you know
Do you do that? No?
Um, just every now and then. I haven't done overlap since I've has symptoms.
OK. So, what was what's your peak flow reading when you're good?
Like normally peak flow reading.
Um
Um, I think
OK. Let's see it's about, um, three eighty, yeah? Yeah? three . OK.
Yeah.
Right. So that's your normal, yeah? Righty-ho, OK. So what we need
Mm-hmm.
OK. Do you have any allergies at all?
Erm, I have a fever.
Sorry, could you repeat that please?
Sorry, I have hay fever.
OK. Now any allergies to medication?
Ohh no
OK. So you're not allergic to anything? OK.
So no allergies. OK, excellent. Righty-ho.
So what we need to do that obviously we you haven't had an asthma check for sometime and it looks like you can be having a small, small exacerbation.
So what, I would like you to be seen by one of our GP's in the next few days.
Mm-hmm.
In the interim, what I'd like you to do is you can use your blue inhaler as and when.
OK. You can use it maximum about every two to four, four hours, but if you're using it that often that means pretty much that, you know, your asthma is really bad. You can use it, but that's not ideal.
Mm-hmm.
But uh, the brown your Clenil. The brown inhaler.
Yeah.
You can up the dose. If you're using just three puffs twice a day, you can increase it to four puffs twice a day.
Yeah. And while, this is to do while you're waiting to see us.
Mm-hmm.
Now, I've mentioned, you know, you're doing you know, increase the, uh, Clenil to four puffs twice a day and you're using the asthma, you know, the blue inhalers every two to four hours.
OK.
And your breathing is getting really worse, then you would need to take yourself to A and E. You shouldn't wait for our appointment.
OK. So, when you'd opt to sneeze you, what we're going to do is we're gonna examine your chest, yeah.
Yeah.
Make you do the peak flow reading. So depending on what we find, you might need some antibiotics and some steroids.
Yeah.
But anyway, while you're at home, we're going to by increasing your Clenil, we are increasing your steroid intake anyway.
OK.
So, yeah. So, any questions you wanted to ask me?
No, that's thanks.
Yeah. So, book an call support, book an appointment to see and I will recommend that meet her face to face.
In the interim, increase your brown inhaler to four puffs twice a day, and your salbutamol inhalers up to every two hourly. But, if you breathing's getting worse and you've not seen us, do take your puffs to A and E.
All right?
Great, OK. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you.
You're welcome. You take care then, bye, bye now, bye. Bye.","**Clinical Note**

[patient] i told her that the scars here was kind of bothering me and i got scar gel . i was using it everyday , but i do n't think i need it now .
[doctor] yeah , that scar did widen a little bit . let me take a closer look , hang on . this one widened a little too , ? the incisions are well healed though with no signs of infection or any redness on either breast , so i'm not concerned .
[patient] yeah , but this one just bothered me a little bit more .
[doctor] i understand . um , you can close your gown now .
[doctor] the only thing that is really going to help out that is to uh , to cut it out and re-close it .
[patient]
[doctor] and you do n't want that , ?
[patient] i mean , not right now .
[doctor] um , you want to come back and revisit um , maybe six months ?
[patient] yeah , i will do that . i still have n't , i still have some more of the gel and i can try using that again .
[doctor] okay . keep doing that twice a day . the gel is going to lighten the color a little bit , which is already pretty light . um , but , just in that area , and it's high tension , so it's going to rub a little bit .
[patient] yeah , but it kind of bothers me a little bit .
[doctor] uh , i do see that . like i said , the only way to really fix that is to cut it out .
[patient] uh- .
[doctor] um , let's take a look in six months and then we'll go from there . sound like a plan ?
[patient] but we have n't hit a full year yet .
[doctor] i know . um , i would n't do any revisions anyway for scar tissue until we're at least a year out anyway .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so let's wait those six months . you can keep using uh , the mederma scar gel twice a day . massage and scar gel will help for the scars . um , you can put it on other scars too , if you need .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , so that's what i would do . let's just get some pictures today so we can keep up um , with them . and keep an eye on these scars and then we'll go from there .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right , well it's good to see you . i'm glad you're doing well .

"Hello?
Hello there.
Uh, hello. Can you hear me OK?
Yes, I can hear you.
OK, great. . I am, yes. Nice to see you here, Oscar. Um, how can I help you this afternoon?
Are you the doctor?
Um, I'm, contacting you because I've been, quite short of breath lately.
OK. Do you want to tell me a bit more about it? When did it all start?
Uh, well it seems to have been, slowly getting worse over the last couple of weeks.
Um, now it's, become quite troublesome, in the last few days.
Uh, I kind of, normally I can walk to the shops, without a problem but, now I'm having to sort of sit down and catch my breath. And I'm really starting to get a bit breathless, just about the house.

And uh, it's got me kind of worried, don't really know what's going on.
OK.
OK. OK. Is there anything you're particularly worried about?
Um, well, I've, I've uh, I've got um, heart failure.
OK.
Uh, I was told that, uh, a while ago.
Um, and I got a bit breathless when I was first diagnosed, and put on some medicine that, that um, that helped, but I'm a bit worried it's just getting worse.
OK.
Right.

Right, OK. So you mentioned you're feeling, uh, short of breath for the last couple of weeks, but mainly the last couple of days it's got a bit worse.
Um, uh, and you're now feeling more breathless on kind of minimal, minimal exertion you mentioned. Um, have you noticed any other symptoms at all, uh, uh, with your breath? So, for example, any pain in your chest?
No pain in my chest.
OK. And have you found yourself coughing, coughing at all?
Um.
Uh, I've got a bit of a dry cough, but it's not too troublesome.
OK. OK. And how's your general health otherwise? Are you feeling uh, weak, lethargic?
Um, I'm feeling a little run-down, um, but otherwise, otherwise pretty normal.
OK.
I've noticed my ankles have got a bit bigger.
OK. And what do you mean by that?
Uh, it's just like, it's sort of swollen up a bit.
OK. Um, is that, is that both ?
Kind of . Um, yeah, both ankles. Yeah, it's a bit embarrassing.
Both ankles?
OK. Uh, I can imagine, yeah. Um, and again, over how long has this, have you noticed this for?
Um, I kind of noticed it the last few days.
Past few days, OK. And is this something that you've had before, in the past?
Uh, I think my ankles did swell up a bit last time, the heart failure was a problem.
OK. OK. Um, fine. OK. So, um, just to really recap, uh, so you're really, in the last couple of weeks, uh, you've been feeling breathless, uh, but worse in the last couple of days. You mentioned you had a bit of a dry cough.
Um, and some swelling in your ankles. Um, reporting no chest pain. Um, and, and have you had any, have you any, have you noticed your heartbeat racing at all? So, palpitations or skipped heartbeat?
No, not really.
OK. And any temperatures or fevers?
Uh, no.
OK. And how about your appetite? Are you eating and drinking OK?
Yeah, I, , I'm, that's fine.
OK. And your waterworks? Are you passing urine OK?
Uh, yeah, but yeah. I usually pee a lot, , ever since the drugs .
Yeah.
Sure, OK. Alright. Um, fine. So, your uh, your past medical history. You mentioned heart failure. Any, any other medical history I should be aware of?
Uh, well I was told I had like a, they called it like a small heart attack.
About, five years ago. Um, I uh, I had, I, I had like some chest pain and, they took me into hospital.
OK.
And um, they, uh, but then I just got better.
OK. And when, when you say a small heart attack, did they give you a name, for what happened, a, a name of a diagnosis?
Um.
Uh, I can't remember. They just called it something a , uh, something like that, a small heart attack.
It's more hard to say. OK. Was it like angina or, um,
Um.
Uh, no they, they said that it, uh, it seemed, it was like, more than angina.
OK.
Um, uh, but um, I didn't, but I only had to stay in hospital for a few days, and, uh.
OK.
OK.
And yeah, I've been OK since then.
You've been OK since then. OK, alright. So, apart from the uh, the heart, the heart problems, the heart failure, any other problems I should be aware of?
Uh, no, I think I'm otherwise, I'm OK.
OK. Um, do you take any regular medications, apart from your diuretics that you're taking? And do you know which ones?
Uh, yeah, I take something called Furosemide.
. Do you know which dose you're taking?
I can't remember, I'm sorry doctor. I have to check.
That's OK.
No problems. Um,
Any other medications?
Uh, yeah. I take Aspirin.
OK.
And uh, Bisoprolol.
The Metoprolol, was it?
Or?
Uh, Bisoprolol.
Sorry, the connection's not very good. OK. Thank you, yeah.

Um, .
And a thousand, OK. Alright. Any allergies at all? Any medications?
Uh, no, no allergies.
No.
OK. And is there anything in the family that's, uh, that, that's uh, that's important for me to know? Any family history of medical problems, heart problems, lung problems?
Uh , my, my father died of a, uh, of a heart attack.
I'm sorry to hear that. And, um, how old was your father when he passed away?
Uh, he was, um, early sixties.
Early sixties, OK. Alright. Anything else I should be aware of?
Um, my mother had osteoporosis.
OK.
Is your mother still with us?
Uh, yeah, she's still living.
OK, alright. Um, and socially, sir, just tell me a bit more about your situation at home. Who lives at home with you?
Uh, I live on my own. Well, I got two cats.
You've got two cats. OK, great. Do they have names?
They're my family. Uh, they're, they're called, um, they're called, Polly and Tim.
OK.
Um, so it's just you and your cats. And um, in terms of day to day, are you working at the moment?
Uh, I work part-time as, a, uh, lorry driver.
OK. And how is that? Is that quite stressful, long hours?
Uh, it's OK. Um, I uh, yeah , when I'm working it's pretty exhausting.
Mm.
Um, I guess I'm a bit worried, that if I get sick I won't, if I get more sick then, I won't be able to work properly.
Yeah, that's certainly a consideration, isn't it? So let's, let's try and get you better soon, so it doesn't have any um, impact on your, on your job.
No.
Uh, and do you find yourself doing a lot of anti-social hours? Do you , do you do a lot of night driving, weekend driving?

Ohh no, I , I , I, I only take shifts during the day, I don't like working at night.
OK.
OK, alright. And what about smoking and alcohol? So, 'cause that can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems. Do you, do you smoke at all?
Not any more.
So, you used to smoke?
Yeah.
And how many did you smoke a day, on average?
Ooh it was about, about a pack a day, back in the day.
Um, and how many, how many years was that for?
Ohh that was, oof, good twenty five years.
OK. And what about the stopping? That must have been difficult for you. stopping. Um, and what, what about alcohol?
I don't drink alcohol.
OK. Do you do much in the way of exercise, sir?
Uh, I try and walk to the shops, at least once a day.
OK.
Um, but uh, that's about it, I've. Yeah, I don't, I don't go running like I used to when i was young.
OK.
Right, OK. And certainly now your symptoms, you, you're, you said you're feeling more breathless even walking to the uh, to the shop, she said.
Um, right. Ohh um, based on your, based on you history, and having listened to your story, I, I wonder whether you've had a flare-up of your heart failure, sir. Um,
Which can sometimes happen. Um, um, and uh,
Mmm.
That.
It's . So, it seems like your heart's not pumping as well as it should be. Um, and obviously having diagnosed with heart failure, there's obviously
What's going on.
Um, that's the first thing that comes to my mind. Um, now there's a couple of options move forward. Um,
Mmm.
Given that you're otherwise well at the moment, and having examined you, your chest, and your saturations and blood pressure are all OK,
I'm quite happy to increase your dose of Furosemide. Maybe, rather than one tablet a day, we can do two tablets a day, for the first few days.
Um, and see, and see how you're getting on.
OK. If you think that'll be better.
Uh,
I think, I think, it's, it's, it's definitely worth treating your symptoms. But what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests, like a blood test, and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart, to see how well your heart's pumping.
OK.
Is that something you've had before? Yeah, so um, an , it's a, it's a general scan of your heart. You might have had this done before, when you were diagnosed. And it's just to get a good
What does that?
Ohh yes, I remember now.
Sorry?
Uh, yeah, I remember now. .
You remember that. OK, fine. That's something I can organize for you today. And, and that might take a week or two weeks for that to be organized. But, I think certainly in the meantime, let's, um,
Let's, let's get a blood test done. We can check your um, you know your full blood count, look for signs of anemia. We can have a check of your kidney function.
Um, and we can definitely increase your um, your Furosemide, uh, to you know, one tablet twice a day.
But I really like, would like you to come back and see me in about a week's time, see how you're getting on. That sound reasonable?
I think that sounds like a good plan.
And of course, in the meantime if you are getting more unwell, feel like you're getting more breathless, or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain, or palpitations or dizziness, then, uh, you know I want you to give me a call sooner than that, and we can have a chat on the phone as well.
OK. I'll see how I get on.
OK? Do you have any questions for me?
Uh, I think that's all pretty clear. Thank you very much Doctor.
Great, and then well I wish you all the best! Have a good day. OK. Thank you.
OK. See you soon.","**SOAP Note**

"Hello.
Ohh hello. Hi, how you doing? Uh, my name's Joe. I'm one of the doctors here at Babylon. Can I just confirm your name please?
Hi.
Yes. Brian .
Yeah, sure. My name's Daniel .
Hi Daniel. And your date of birth? .
Yeah. May .
Nineteen ninety two.
Ninety two. OK, Daniel. And uh, are you in a, a comfortable and confidential place to talk?
Yeah. Totally.
, happy to go ahead. Great. How can I help?
Um, yeah, I just, my chest has been feeling really tight.
OK. And how long has this been going on for Daniel?
Uh, for about.
Three hours now.
OK. And, so, tight chest, three hours. Um, and, so you're born in ninety two, so that makes you twenty six?
Um, and, you are, uh. Any shortness of breath at all, with that?
Twenty six, yeah.
Yeah, like a little bit, um. Yeah, a little bit short of breath, not too bad.
Uh, any cough? Wheeze?
Yeah, I'm feeling a bit wheezy, as well. Kind of cough , coughing, yeah.
Slight cough, yeah. , sore throat? Runny nose? Sore ears?
Yeah.
You know I had a cold last week, and, it's not as bad as it was, but yeah, I had a sore throat, I had a runny nose. Uh, just feeling under the weather.
Mm-hmm. Are you feeling better now, other than the tight chest?
I mean I feel worse, but the runny nose isn't as bad any more. .
Right. OK, OK, but you now, now you've got this, this um. So you've still got, still got uh, symptoms of a cold, essentially?
Yeah, but the cough's kind of stuck around.
Uh, ooh, yeah, OK.
And are you coughing up anything?
Uh, no.
And, um, do you have any other medical problems, like asthma?
Yeah, yeah, I have asthma, I've had it for a while now, um.
And then I have like, a hayfever, you know, and some allergies just to dust, stuff like that.
, OK.
You have any, inhalers? Or any, any medications?
Um, yeah, so, uh, you know the um, uh, Ventolin. It's called uh, Salbutamol.
Yeah.
I got that one, and then I have a steroid, a Clenil, Clenil inhaler.
Clenil, Clenil Modulite, yeah, OK.
Yeah, yeah.
And um, uh, have you been using Clenil and the Ventolin? And how often have you been using them?
Um, well to be honest, I was away at uni last week, and I forgot to bring it with me, so I haven't really in the past week. Uh.
Both of them?
Because , because um, sorry, they ran out and I, I forgot to, go and grab the next one.
Yeah, sure.
About a week ago. Yeah.
OK. All right, all right. So, so, so you've, you haven't got any Clenil, or any Ventolin at the moment?
Not with me right now, no, I ran out.
OK. All right. Um, and , any drug allergies, that you know of?
No, no, not allergic to anything. Just like, just the, dust and stuff, but nothing, no drugs.
OK, great. Now, uh, do you, anyone in your family have any medical problems, that you know of?
Um, yeah, my mum has eczema, and my dad has asthma. , ohh, when I was young, I also had eczema.
And I had a milk protein allergy, when I was young too.
Hmm. OK. Um.
Right. So, just uh, , do you have any other, sort of concerns? Or ideas about what might be going on? Or, um, hopes for this consultation?
Um.
Not really, like I feel like asthma's probably a part of it, and, probably getting my, inhalers would be helpful
Um. It's just kinda scary, 'cause I haven't had, a time like this where I've been so, tight, uh, in a long time.
Yeah, absolutely, I can, I can imagine.
Um, well, it certainly sounds like uh, you've, you've had this cold, so you've got wheezy with a cough. Um, and it's non-productive cough, and you're short of breath. Uh, is the cough worse at night-time?
I mean, it gets a little bit worse at night but, basically, just pretty consistent, and it hasn't gone away.
Yeah.
OK. And you've got this tight, tight chest. But you, you wouldn't say you've got chest pains? It's more of a tight chest, is it?
No, not really pain, it's more like, tight.
It just feels like sometimes, I can't get a full breath in, you know.
Yeah, sure. Um, OK. Well, I, I would quite like to, uh, certainly get you some, uh, Ventolin, Clenil Modulite. Have you had asthma exacerbations in the past?
Not in a long time. When I was young, a little bit, more like, back in high school. Um, but, I've been pretty good at taking my , my inhalers, so, not, not so much any more.
Yeah.
Have you ever been to hospital, uh, as an inpatient? As in, you know, stayed in there overnight, for asthma?
Yeah, when I was in high school, I had to have a tube put down my throat.
Ohh, OK. So you, so, so you, uh, you , you went to hospital, and had a, a, . So you stayed in hospital for a few days did you, with an asthma exacerbation?
Yeah I did, yeah.
OK, but currently you're just on Ventolin and Clenil? And you haven't got any of those steroids, uh, those inhalers at the moment?
Yeah, I'm doing pretty good, I'm doing pretty good, just on the Clenil, and the Salbutamol.
OK. When, sorry, how old were you when you had that severe asthma exacerbation?
Uh, I think I was like seventeen.
Sixteen maybe.
Sure. OK. Um.
Just to quantify how short of breath you are, um, I don't suppose you've got a peak flow with you? No, you won't have will you.
No, no.
Um, are you able to, uh, like walk up, flights of stairs OK? Walk on the flat OK, without getting to short of breath? Or um, are you short of breath at rest?
Uh, I'm definitely not short of breath at rest, like, except for that feeling I was describing.
It does when I'm walking up stairs, I do feel like, I have a little bit, more short of breath than I would normally be.
Sure. Yeah. OK, but you're not short of breath at rest at the moment?
No, no, no I'm not.
OK, fine. So, what, what I think, um, and just to, just to go over, . Is there anything you had hoped about getting other than the uh, a, prescription for your inhalers? Was there anything else you'd hoped about getting from this?
Well I just wanna know that I'm OK, to just like keep. I just don't wanna have to get, um, that, that intubation again.
Sure, yeah, no, absolutely. Well, I'm really glad you have talked to me today. I think what we can do is, is give you a prescription for, uh, some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you, within the hour, I would hope.
Uh, .
Um, and, uh, I think, what, the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a, dose of steroids. So this is, these are tablets which, um, you can take for five days. Uh, two tablets in the morning.
And, uh, that should just dampen down your asthmatic response, OK.
OK.
Um, now there are some side effects to the steroids. Which I should really tell you about, but please read the label, that's associated with. Don't be too worried about the side effects.
They're , most, you know , most of the time the steroids are, very well tolerated. And, uh, you . Have you had them in the past, do you know of?
Sorry, sorry, you were cutting in and out a little bit there. What were you saying?
. Have you had steroids in the past?
Um, I can't remember, probably. I think so.
Probably, yeah I would too. So, um, they, they can come, they can make you, your mood change, can be slightly low or too, slightly high.
Can give you, a high blood sugar, um, and, uh, their. Uh, , they can also cause rash, nausea, um, headaches, but, mostly is well-tolerated, and it should help your asthma an awful lot.
Um, uh, what I'd like to do is, is send you these, the, some prescriptions for your, uh, inhalers, , ongoing. So you, um, you can, once you get better from this asthma attack, you can, you can, use the Clenil Modulite in the morning, with Ventolin as a PRN. , so, a Ventolin when you need to, um, when you're getting wheezy.
OK.
OK.
If you should start to use the Ventolin more than, uh, every three hours.
Uh, at, at anytime, it's a good idea to seek medical attention. So, um, see a doctor, um, in some capacity.
Yeah.
Uh, and, the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer, which would allow the medication to actually, go into your lungs better. Have you, do you know what a spacer is? Have you used one before?
Yeah, yeah, I, somebody told me how to use one a while ago. I don't, I don't really use it, to be honest, but.
Have you got one?
I think I do, I have one somewhere.
OK. All right. Well, um, I'll send you another one, and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially, uh, couple of puffs to prime it, inside, breathing in and out, um, uh, for five or , five or ten breaths.
OK.
Uh, yeah. So.
Uh, was there anything else that was on your mind? Or you're concerned about at this stage?
, I think you got me covered.
OK, and, and uh, I might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify first seven days, but uh, I think I would advise you just to, rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better, if you're OK with that. All right?
OK, .
All righty. Well, thank you very much.
OK. No worries. Any deterioration in your symptoms, like worsening shortness of breath. Um, or just generally concerning symptoms, uh, pain in your chest tightness, uh, feeling light-headed.
Uh, then, seek further medical attention anytime please. OK?
All right, sounds good.
OK. Thank you.
OK, thank you. Bye bye.

"You have to do it, part of your training as a doctor.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi. Can you hear me?
. Yes, I can hear fine.
Hi. My name's Doctor Gohill, I'm one of the general practitioners, that works here. Can I check your name and date of birth please?
Uh, I am, uh, Patrick Smith.
Hi.
Uh, thirty five years old.
Um, October, seventh. Uh.
ninety , three something.
Great.
And Patrick, are you in a, space, that's private and quiet?
Yes.
Great, and so, we're OK to chat?
Yes, we are.
OK. So it says here, um, you are feeling hot, and have had severe headaches. Is that correct?
Yeah. It's, it's really affecting my work. Uh, uh, it comes and goes. Uh.
Uh, I kind of, feel like, uh, it's, it's hard 'cause I, I , kinda lose my appetite.
Also. Uh, one thing that's kinda weird is, I just sometimes also get like some, tingling in my arms.
OK.
. And, like, especially if, for example when I, come into the elevator, in the morning.
OK.
I, I can uh, of have, my heart is beating, kinda fast.
OK.
So, those are lots of things. Are they all happening at the same time?
Almost randomly like. Yeah, it's, it's, it's at different , times.
And, do they all happen at the same time? Or is it one thing one time, and one ?
, one time, one thing at a time.
OK. So, let's start with the headaches. When they do come, do you have any idea the headache is going to come?


Uh, not really but, generally during, work times.
So, it's normally at work?
I'm at work, I'm in a meeting, or on my laptop.
OK. And, where does the headache sit in your head? Is it the front, or the back?
Um, I can't say, so like, kind of over.
. OK. And, does it else?


Does it go anywhere else?
, the headache? No, it's mostly in the front, and then yeah, it just kind of stays there.
And, when you have the headaches, specifically, do you feel sick?
Yeah.
, not, not, not really, but it's like, making it hard. I, yeah, I kind of feel a little bit nauseous maybe. Um.
OK.
And sometimes I also feel like.
Uh, yeah. It's like uh, maybe, probably, breathing or something.
OK.
No.
And, do you normally get headaches, before all of this started?
Uh, so.
No, I, I feel like my, like, health situation was mostly under control.

OK.
Yeah.
And then let's.
But it , it started roughly when I changed jobs.
OK. So, talk to me about your job, what do you do?
I'm a lawyer.
And, do you work in London at the moment?
Yes.
So, do you get these headaches on your commute in to work?
Not really. I get it, mostly when I'm, at work.
OK, and tell me about what you do. Do you sit in front of a computer most of the time? Or do you speak to people?
Like fifty-fifty. I go to meetings and then uh, sit in front of a computer.
OK.
There's a lot of reading.
And, these things have happened mostly when you're sitting at your computer?
Um.
, yeah, it happens then, yeah.
OK, and tell me, what did you do, before being a lawyer?
Uh, no, I was a lawyer at previous job as well.
OK.

So, talk to me about the stress that you're under at the moment. If, uh, ten out of ten is, extremely stressful, and one out of ten is being on vacation. Where would moment?

Think it's, seven, or eight.
And, is that normal for you?
Yeah, it's like, a law firm, like, there's always pressure.
OK.
So, you mentioned your headaches. You also mentioned your reduced appetite. So, you don't want to eat as much.
Yeah.
Have you lost weight?
Yes.
Can you remember how much you've lost?
Five pounds.
And, is that because you're going to the gym? Or is that unintentional?
It's not intentional, no.
OK. So, have you noticed your clothes feeling looser?
, not really, ah, no.
And, have people said, or commented that you've lost weight?
No.
Great. And, another thing that you also mentioned. Is that you noticed tingling in your hand.
Yeah.
So, talk to me about that. Is it in one hand? Or both hands?
Both.
And, do you get that in your legs as well?
No.
And, what does it feel like, the tingling?
Quick picking, yeah.
And again, is this the first time you've noticed this?
Yeah.
OK.
And the other two things that I've just, jotted down. Is, you're feeling hot, but you didn't mention that.
Is that correct?

Uh, but like.
I would say like, I get this like, feeling of, short, like, , short of breath, sometimes.
OK.
So, like, that could be what, you we're, referring to.
Yes. So, do you feel short of breath while you're sitting at your desk?
Yeah, no. Yes. Sorry, yeah.
. OK. And, how about when you're exercising?
No.
OK.
And the last thing is. You mentioned that you noticed your heart beating?
Yeah.
Again, how often do you get that?
I, I, when I like, it's maybe once a day, uh, maybe more. Uh.
There's one more thing that I, I think I should mention, like, I do have like, some loss of libido at home.
OK. How long has that been happening for?
Same amount of time really, like, since I changed my job.
Fine. And, apart from all of these things that you've told me. Do you have any other medical problems?
Uh, well I have, hyperthyroidism.
OK. And, do you take medications for that?
Thyroxine.
And, are you remembering to take your medications?
Yes.
OK. And, do you drink or smoke?
Yes.
How much do you drink?
Like, once a week, couple of glasses, of wine.
OK. And, how about smoking?
No.
And, uh, I need to ask this to all of my patients, but do you do anything else recreational, in terms of drugs?
No.
OK. So, you've never taken cocaine, or marijuana?
. No.
OK, thank you. And, are you allergic to anything?

Good. So, you've told me lots of things happening to you at the moment, and I can understand, they probably feel quite strange and unusual.
Yeah.
Um, I think the best course of action is, you come and see, one of our doctors, in the clinic.
Yeah.
We can give you an examination, and what that means is, we check your heart and your breathing.
Yeah.
Make sure that those things are functioning correctly.
Yeah.
And probably do some blood tests, for your thyroxine.
Yep.
And take it from there. How does that sound?
That sounds, uh, very good. Thank you.
I think before we give you any medications, we should see you in person.
OK. .
So, what we're going to do is book an appointment. Or I think you can book an appointment through the app, to come and see us clinic, and see one of my colleagues.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
I'll let them know what you've told me today, so you won't have to repeat exactly what you've said.
Thank you.
Great. Do you have any questions?
Right.
No, that was it. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Yep, bye.","**Clinical Note**

"Hello?

. Good morning, Tim. Um, how can I help you this morning?
Um, so I'm
Having some, some pain, uh, in my tummy, like the lower part of my tummy. Um and I've just been feeling, quite, hot and sweaty.
OK.
Right, I'm sorry to hear that. When, when did your symptoms all start?
About two days ago.
OK. And whereabouts in your tummy is the pain, exactly?
Uh, like below my belly button, it's like quite, sore when I press on it.
OK. Did the pain come on quite suddenly, or was it more gradual?
, it hasn't been, it's more gradual and it's just, it is getting a bit worse now.
OK, OK. And can you describe the pain to me?
Uh, it's kind of like a, a, I guess a burning pain. Uh, and it's just right there yeah, in that spot, like uh, that's mostly where I'm feeling it. It hasn't spread anywhere else.

Just in, just below your belly button you uh, mentioned.
Yeah.
OK. Um, and is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
It's pretty constant, it's like getting worse. Um, it's not like, I , I can still move and walk around. Uh, I mean I'm still kind of functioning, it's just uh, I'm aware of it time.

. Mm-hmm. OK. Um, and with the pain have you noticed any other symptoms, at all? So, for example, let's, let's focus first on your bowels. Are your bowels working OK?
Yeah, I had a bit of constipation, but that's better, now. That was like, since last week.
OK. So you've got no other symptoms, like diarrhea or loose stools?
No, I'm , I'm, my bowel movements are normal now.
No.
OK. And, what about your waterworks? Are you passing urine OK?
Yeah, I'm fine, that's fine, that's. I did notice that I was a little, the urine was a little pink, in colour. But I haven't like, it hasn't really been burning, specifically or hurting when I pee and uh.
And I did notice I was going to the, I was peeing more, regularly, but I have been drinking lots of fluids. So I wasn't sure, um, I wasn't sure, um, like you know, if that was related to the pain.
Mm.
And when you mentioned pink urine, do you, was there any blood at all in your urine? Or was it difficult to say?
I can't say, I mean maybe.
OK, alright. But otherwise, it doesn't hurt, uh, or or or sting, when you pass urine?
And I haven't noticed that it really burns or anything like that. Um, just that I'm, peeing more than , more regularly.
OK.
OK. Um, OK. And um, moving on to other symptoms, have you noticed any vomiting, or feeling nauseous at all?
Just a little nauseous, um, but no vomiting.
No vomiting. Any temperatures or fevers?
I haven't , I felt a bit hot and sweaty, but I haven't really measured it, so I can't really say.
OK, fine. Um, uh, uh, and Kim, have to ask um, uh all all all patients. This this question is about your cycle, if you don't mind me asking. Um, are you currently um, are you currently sexually active?
Yes.
Uh, yeah I've, I have had the same partner, I am, we were last sexually active about four days ago. Um, my last STD screen was normal, which was about six months ago.
OK. So you've had no other partner since then.
No, the .
OK. Um, uh, and do you use any contraception at all?
Uh, I'm, on the Implanon. I had the Implanon inserted about a year ago.
At the moment, OK, fine. Um, are you still having periods?
Yes.
When was your last period?
Uh, my last period was about, three weeks ago. I mean, two weeks ago.
Two week scare, OK. So, is there any chance you could be pregnant? I know you've got an implement in there, but is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant? It's something for us to think about
Well, we don't use any other barrier, method so, we just use the , I just have the Implanon and the same partner. Um.
Theoretically, if the Implanon, hasn't been working then I could be pregnant, but I don't suspect .
Yeah, OK. Well it's something for us to think about. Um, uh, maybe worth taking a pregnancy test later on, just to confirm that. Um
OK. And, and so, just to summarize so far, if you don't mind, it's really for the last couple of days, it's tummy pain that's really affected you, mainly lower down towards your belly button. It's quite burning, you said. It's getting worse. Um, you noticed some pink urine.
Um, but no burning or stinging pain when you pass urine. Your bowels are working OK.
You've felt a little bit nauseous, um, and feeling hot and sweaty. Have I got that all right?
Yeah, that sounds, very accurate.
Is there anything else, perhaps, that you feel like you should share with me at this stage, anything that might be important?
I don't think so, I think I've, you , we've covered everything that's really bothering me.
Yeah, OK. Um, tell me, tell me a bit more about your um, medical history otherwise. Are you normally fit and well?
Yeah, , well, I haven't had any, surgical, I don't have any surgical history.
I don't have any previous, I haven't had any operations before, or, and I'm not on any other medication, I just have the Implanon.

OK. Um, have you had anything like this before in the past? Any similar symptoms?
I've never , I've never had these symptoms before.
No, OK. Um
Fine. Um, any other family history I should be aware of? Anything relevant, family, uh related to bowels, maybe related to history?
No, not that , not that I'm aware of, no.
OK. Alright. Um, and socially, just tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you?
Uh, I live in a share house, and with two other, two other room-mates.
OK. Um, and uh, are you currently working?
Yeah, I currently, I am currently .
What do you do for work?
I am an accountant.
OK. Um
OK. Um, Do you smoke at all, Kim?
No.
No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
Uh , socially I drink, but uh, I don't think more, more than normal. .
No, OK.
OK. Um, just before I go to the examination, I just want to go through just some few screening questions if that's OK, yes or no.
Uh, we've, we've covered the majority of them already. Uh, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else.
All right.
Um, how's your, how's your chest? How's your breathing? Um, any
I don't feel short of breath uh, or, I'm not having any problems, or I don't have a cough or anything that's , worrying me.
OK. Any uh, funny heartbeats or rhythms, palpitations?
Not that it, no.
OK. Any headaches? Any problems with your vision?
No.
No, OK. Alright. Um,
Fine, OK. Um, So really just uh, moving on, um,
And so based, based on your story really, uh, uh Kim it's, it's it's difficult. it's it's um, you know you've got some tummy pain. You don't exactly know what's causing it. It could be a few different things that could be causing your pain.
Could just be a, you know, could just be a urine infection, for example. Could just be something related to your gut. Um, could just be something related to your, you know, a pregnancy-related cause. Um, and so it's probably worth doing some tests initially.
to try and rule out um, what's going on here. Um, which I can organize for you today.
OK.
Um, and basically those tests, we, we'll have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed. But certainly, it if it's been going on for the last couple of days, um,
Uh, you know, it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for a maybe urine infection. And, so it's an
. Yeah, I , can we do that instead of me, going for tests, and then seeing how that goes?
Yeah, absolutely. So, um I think it's certainly worth, you know covering you with some antibiotics today.
Uh, but i still want you to bear in mind, you know, have a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here.
And, um, and I want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days time, if your symptoms are not getting any better, or indeed if they're getting worse.
So, things to look out for would be, you know, worsening tummy pain, um, if you're feeling really hot or sweaty, your temperature's not coming down um, vomiting et cetera. Does that make sense?
Yeah, I think I'm happy with that plan.
OK. Um, you can try just regular painkillers, uh, Paracetamol would be advisable. Um, make sure you drink plenty of fluids.
You can try some cranberry juice as well, which uh, can sometimes help with your urine symptoms.
Um, take the antibiotics, uh, and give me a call, you know, if you are worried about anything else.
Uh, sure. That sounds great. Thank you very much. Um, should I just collect the script at my pharmacy?

Yeah, if I send it straight to your pharmacy, start the antibiotics today, something called Trimethoprim. Um, you can take two tablets, uh, one tablet twice a day for three days.
OK.
OK, , that sounds great.
Uh, , let's see how you get on.
OK. Thank you very much.
Great. All the best!
Bye.

Basically, I, I sometimes go with my friends to, to this place called .
And, we, we regularly have like usually I have like a normal vegetarian soup or something.
Mm-hmm.
And yeah, and, then I wanted to try something new.
Mm-hmm.
Um, so what happened was, I, I ordered a prawn soup it it's it it's called it's like a soup, I ordered a prawn one this time.
Yeah.
And, yeah and then my feel like my lips started feeling a little weird just in the in the corner sort of on the left first.
Mm-hmm.
And then, I don't know and then, we went back we had little bit of chat, of banter I wasn't really, paying attention.

Uh, now I feel the that there is a swelling, there is like a swelling on my, on my upper lip and it's kind of getting bigger. I don't know what to do.
Yeah.
Right.
All right. So when did you have the prawn soup? What time?
That was, that must have been just after work, so maybe like around seven.
OK, around seven o'clock, and um how long did it take to develop the swelling?
Well I wasn't really paying attention so, it must have been like, must have been like, I don't know half an hour maybe.
OK in half an hour you developed the swelling yeah?
Yeah.
OK, and it's getting bigger and bigger?
Yeah it's it it still feel it like, really pumping blood and it's kinda getting bigger it feels like it's getting worse.
OK. So, just a few more questions. Um, so you mentioned about your swelling of your lips. Is there any feeling of swelling in in your throat, like your throat is closing up, any feeling like that?
Yeah actually, I, I feel like I can't breathe that well right now.
OK.
And do you feel like, like your chest is tight?
And I don't know if it's the chest it just generally feels a little difficult, but yeah it might be, I'm not sure.
OK.
OK, right.
And just a few have you ever these any kind of lip swelling in the past? After eating any food?
Yeah, well, maybe, I remember like a year ago.
A year ago I was, out with my friends.
Mm-hmm.
And I think we went like, to a late night kinda Chinese place, and I remember that I was quite drunk to be honest.
Sure, OK.
And I remember that after like having that very late.
I've woke up the next morning quite swollen up and had also I, felt really bad and quite difficult breathing, but I don't know what it was I had it was like a curry or something I think.
OK.
Right.
OK. Uh, and what did you take at that time? Did you use anything like antihistamine or anything, when you had that last time?
But I generally have asthma so, I took I, I take, ohh what's it called? Salbutamol inhalers?
Yeah.
Yeah, so I do take that regularly but I've always taken it. I generally have asthma.
And any other inhalers? Is it just the Salbutamol that you use? Any other brown inhalers?
Ohh I, no I don't think so, no.

OK right and um so, do you use antihistamines like Cetirizine, Loratadine, Piriton, any of those, kind of things?
Hmm, no. I, I got no I do sometimes but I don't know which ones, but I have a peanut allergy as well, like always had it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I, think I do get antihistamines for that but I'm not sure which ones.
And any point because you had peanut allergy, any time you have to ever use like an injection?
When I was a kid I think I remember my mom told me about it, but I don't know what it was 'cause I was small and I've changed doctors since.

[doctor] fair enough . that's all right . um , if it bothers you , that's what , uh , that's why i recommended last time
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , so as we move into the summer it may be something that you are more interested in pursuing doing that , uh , but if you feel like the acne on your face ... do you feel like the acne on your face is improving ?

[patient] uh , yeah .
[doctor] okay . um , all right . so the tretinoin , uh , usually lasts patients a couple of months . you probably have n't refilled that , right ?
[patient] uh , yeah , we did once , i think .

I don't know. I, I like my job. It's just you know, it's a bit more work than usual.
OK. OK. And just very briefly, just in terms of smoking uh, do you smoke at all?
Um, yeah occasionally, you know, cigars and things on company parties.
OK so not, not regular. Um and what about alcohol?
No.
Um, occasionally yeah I would have some. I'm, I'm not a very big drinker.

socially with work.
Yeah.
Um OK. Um so um
just having listened to your story, um uh really just to summarize you know since the last four days you've been feeling generally quite unwell, sore throat, runny nose, bit of a dry cough, bit of muscle pain, weakness.
Um had initial fever, but now settled. Um I don't think there's a lot to worry about. I think you probably have, you know a bit of a viral, what we say viral illness, maybe a viral upper respiratory tract infection, or maybe early signs of a flu.
Um these normally last about seven to days and just gets better really, um over time. But things you can do to really help yourself, um is get plenty of rest. I'd probably advise you taking a day or two off work if you can. Um
Making yourself, pushing fluids and make yourself well-hydrated. Continue with the regular Paracetamol, Ibuprofen. Um and and you should see how things go, really. Um if next week you're still not better, I'd like you to come back and see me.
Um is that clear? Does that, does that make, does that make
Yeah, yeah, that's that's , it makes sense. Uh, I think I'll take a couple days off, and see how it goes.
Yeah, yeah.
and things to look out for if you're really not getting better, if you if you have a high fever, or your breathing is becoming a bit more labored, or chest pain, I'd like you to come back and see me much sooner, give me a call. Um and we can help you out. OK?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah I understand. Uh, I'll uh, I'll take care.
Great. Have a great day. Good luck with your work. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye.
Thank you. Thank you. You too. Bye bye.","**Clinical Note**

It'll be good if, none of those.
Great, so, so yeah. I can provide a bit of reassurance, um, and uh, we can talk about those a little bit, as well. And was there anything you were particularly expecting, or hoping to get out of this consultation? Um.

Three or four days ago, you started develop . And is the cough worse at night-time?
No, no, it's the same throughout the whole day.
Same throughout the day. Um, and, uh, when you say you're short of breath.

Uh.
OK. And in general, would you say you're feeling, you're, you're beginning to, to feel better? Worse? Or, or sort of, um, staying the same?
, so it's like, it's up and down. So, so let's see, so I, , it started last week, and I stayed home from work two days this week.
I think it was maybe, Tuesday and then Thursday. So like, I felt better and then worse again, and then better and then worse again. So it's been, yeah, a kind of constant, but constant and being, variable, if that makes .
OK.
And I just , need to ask any, other sort of risk factors. Um.
That you may have. So, , um, no sort of significant weight loss? Um, or unexplained weight loss? Any ?
So no weight loss, but I have been, have been losing my appetite recently. And I mean, I usually eat a lot so, and I, and I enjoy eating as well, but like, so that's been a bit concerning.
You've been losing your appetite recently?
Yes.
And you're a little bit concerned about that? But you haven't, you haven't lost any weight, that you think of?
Yes.
No. Not that .
And any, um, sort of rashes or anything? Or, uh, , and you.
No. Not .
Not that, not that you can think of. OK.
Um. So, I would ask to examine you now, but um, I, I don't know if I could sort of look inside your throat, at least. To see if there's a, probably, there's.
Ohh, we can try .
Ohh no, well, no, it's OK, I , might think about doing a. Have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck? That you can feel?

Uh.
No.
No that you, no, OK.
Um. And, so finally, you, you were talking about, uh, . I mean, it sounds to me that, um, you've been a little bit up and down. Sore throat. Developed a dry cough.
Um, you are slightly short of breath, but not too overly concerningly short of breath. What I would say, we're just coming to the end of consultation now, . If you feel significantly worse .
Mm-hmm.
Um. Uh, if you get more short of breath, or sudden change in your breathlessness. Um, or breathlessness that you are concerned about. Then I would advise you to see, no , go and see a GP. Um, and actually see somebody physically.
Um, uh, but I think, for now I can sort of, uh, try and reassure you that, um, if this clears up, as I expect it would. So, I expect this to sort of be getting better in the next, four or five days. Um, if it's not, please get in touch with a medical professional again.
Um, and, uh, I would expect it to, and so therefore, I wouldn't be concerned about tuberculosis
Um, your concerns about lung cancer, are. And, was that the other thing you're concerned about?
Ohh yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. So, so, um, again, if you're not getting better, please see somebody again.
Um, I've just got four seconds now. So, nice talking to you. And, have we gotta? We gotta, tidy up, yeah. OK, so, uh.
All right.
Uh, and I'll provide you with a sick note, just to give you a few more days off work.
Um, and paracetemol. Lots of fluids. Um, and, uh, rest up. And, as I say, if you're not feeling better, please get in touch. OK?

Have a good day.

Um, well, um, I'm I'm concerned that some of the symptoms you've got may be, um, symptoms of a stroke.

Nineteen years old OK Amanda, and how can I help you this afternoon?
Um, so it's being going on for a few days now. Um, it's not happened before and I'm bit worried. I've uh it quite hurts when I kind of pee.

Um, and yeah it's like I'm going to the toilet a lot more, um.
And it's really, like I can't, like go to uni properly. I'm just like constantly looking for the toilet.

Um, and it kind of hurts sometimes when I'm, like in at the bottom of my tummy as well.
Right OK. I'm sorry to hear there's a lot going on there and I can, see why it's affecting you. Um, so you mentioned it's been going on for last three days, mainly the burning pain when you pass urine. Um, you said you're going to the toilet more often as well, that right?
Uh, yeah it's been going on for a little bit longer than three days I think actually, maybe just under a week. Um.
Ohh and a week, sorry my . OK, uh.
Sorry no I didn't explain it properly before, um yeah no I it's been going on for about just under a week.

Um, and yeah I notice a sort of burning, stinging, when I when I go to the toilet, yeah.
Are you noticing any, anything in your urine, predominantly blood or um, discolouration of urine?
Um, I think, well today I noticed, um, that it was like a bit pink.
The, the urine.

OK, uh of any kind of frank blood? I mean red blood at all, in your urine?
Yeah, I think just today .
Um, I think it was probably but I don't know it was pink so.
OK. Um, fine we'll we'll have to definitely explore that in a little bit or detail later on. Um, you also mentioned some tummy pain as well, can you tell me a bit more about that pain?
Yeah it's kind of at the bottom of my tummy, um, uh mainly when I go to the loo, I think that's when it's worse.
OK. Um, can you describe it crampy pain? Is it more of a burning pain?
Um, I wouldn't describe it as crampy I don't think it's like a period pain, it's a bit different, it's, it's hard to say, an achey pain I suppose.
OK.
An aching pain, OK. And does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards your back? Towards your sides?
No, no, no.
OK, all right. Um, any other symptoms? Nausea? Vomiting?
No, no nausea vomiting.
OK. Any temperatures or fevers?
Um no, no not that I've noticed.
OK, all right. And how are your bowels at the moment? Are your bowels working OK?
Uh I, I usually have a bit of problems with my bowels anyway, so I don't think it's any, different, from what it usually is.
OK, and when, when when you say you have problems, what kind of problems do you normally have?
Um, I think I have, um, IBS, um, so I just kinda pass, uh, my bowels like quite, quite a lot.
Right.
Um, and sometimes it's quite, it's quite variable like sometimes it's a bit softer, sometimes it's a bit, sorry if it's a bit disgusting but like, sometimes it's a bit uh harder and kind of hard to predict.

OK, all right but, and you've noticed no new symptoms? No, no, no new symptoms in your bowels?
Like, yeah OK.
Uh. OK, all right. Um, and Amanda sometimes we have to ask quite sensitive questions as you can imagine. Um, uh, can I ask? Are you currently uh, are you currently sexually active? At the moment?
No, no, not
Uh uh yeah um, I have a, a long-term, um, boyfriend.
OK, and um, have you noticed any other discharge from down below? So, from from the front passage?
Hmm no I don't think so. Nothing unusual.
OK. Have you, do you use any form of contraception?
Uh yeah, uh I'm um on the pill.
The pill. What kind of pill is it? Is it combined pill or the mini-pill?
Uh, combined pill.
OK, fine. Um, when was the last time you had um, unprotected sex?
If you don't want me asking.
Um, uh, I mean, mean unprotected as in like no, no condoms or anything?
Yeah, exactly.
Um, I, I guess 'cause, um, I don't really use condoms with my boyfriend, like.
I dunno we've just kind of agreed, uh, so um I guess, a week ago, two weeks ago , quite quite .
Yep, a week ago, OK all right.
What I'm trying get at is whether um, uh there's any chance you could be pregnant at all. Uh, I know you're on the pill, but um we're we, nonetheless we do have to ask. Um when was your last, when was your last period?


Um, two weeks ago.
Two weeks ago OK, all right. Just something for us, to bear in mind, if your symptoms don't get any better OK, um.
Fine, in terms of your general health otherwise at the moment are you, uh eating and drinking OK?
Uh, yeah, yeah eating drinking OK. Um, I did have one kinda concern I dunno

So I I smoked, uh this is quite bad, but I smoked weed for the first time.
Uh, like a week and a half ago, I I just wondered whether it's related at all, probably not but I just thought I'd get some advice from you.
Sure, well thanks for sharing with me. Um, so, I, I don't think it's is related to your symptoms, I think it probably just pure pure coincidence, um.
Sure OK.
Sure.
But, uh, you know I do strongly advise you to you know, um, make it a regular habit if you can. Um, just for your, just for your general health moving forwards, OK?
OK.
Um, fine. Moving on, in terms of your health otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions , apart from the IBS, is there anything else I should be aware of?
Sure .
No, nope.
No, OK great. And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis, apart from the, um, combined pill?
Apart from the pill, um, I take, um, something for the IBS as well. Um it begins with an M, it's pretty hard to pronounce like something , maybe.
was it, yeah OK.
Yeah, yeah that's it. Yeah, yeah that's right.
OK, and is that for the cramps, the crampy pain?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah OK, and do you have any allergy to any medications?
Um, yeah I think there was an antibiotic, um, called Clindamycin mycin .
OK, OK, OK.
Then I took like something and yeah that, that didn't, go too well, with me.
Ritib, OK sure, I'll make a note of that. Um, in terms of family history, any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys?
No, no.
No, or generally anything else, good. And socially, tell me a bit more about your home situation, who's at home with you?
Um, so I am living in halls at the moment, uh at uni um, so uh, uh, I'm just living with a flatmate I suppose, um.

But my family, uh, live kind of outside of London not too far away. Um, so yeah the my family are fine and I see them now and then. Uh, yeah things I think, I think they're OK generally.
Very good.
Great, and what are you studying at university?
I'm studying, uh, English.
English, OK good, and how are you enjoying your course?
Yeah, yeah it's it's going well thanks. Just kind of started a few months ago, a few months ago and yeah I, I really enjoy it. Yeah, yeah it's really fun.
Good.
Very good, very good, good. Um, in terms of smoking and alcohol, do you, do you participate in either?
Uh, as I admitted before I tried weed for the first time, uh, but, uh, I don't smoke. Uh ,I drink occasionally, um, kind of socially, um, with friends .
O K
OK, what, what's made you have your first joint last week? Was
Um, I it was just a party,.Um, there were other people doing it, um.
OK.
I kind of was a little bit tipsy so, probably wasn't thinking quite straight. Um, but yeah I, I completely agree it's not something I wanna get into on a regular basis.

Sure, uh, and obviously as your doctor I'm here to look after you so yeah I I would strongly recommend you, you know, to avoid if you can. Great, um, fine so, at this stage I wouldn't normally examine you, but I think based on your story I think, um, you know, uh, I'm reassured.
Sure.
But the fact that I, I I think it's, um, probably just a simple what we'd say a UTI or a cystitis, bladder infection.
OK.
Uh, you know you haven't got any other symptoms that, suggest to me that there's anything to worry about, so things like fevers and back pain.
Um, would be more worrying for me to hear. Um, so it's something we can treat quite readily with antibiotics. Um, so we've got a choice of two antibiotics something called Trimethoprim or, Nitrofurantoin which is a three day course.


Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
And normally they're usually quite effective, um, for your symptoms. It's probably worth giving us a urine sample today as well if you can, so we can send it off to the lab.

And see exactly what's going on there. Um, start the antibiotics, make sure you're well hydrated, drink plenty of fluids.
OK.

Um, if you are having some pain, simple Paracetamol, um, would probably be advisable.
Yeah.
Um, we'll see what the urine sample shows. Um, and if it is indeed positive, we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones.
OK.
Um, but if things still are still not getting any better next week come back and see me, and we can have another look again.
OK, OK uh great. Um, with, with the urine sample, um, uh, how do I go about doing that, do you know? Is it through the app?
So if I'll give yeah no it's a well uh so yeah good question, so I will give you I will organise uh for you to come in, and drop off a sample at one of our practices, um which we can test there and then, at the urine and send it off to the lab uh we can back in touch with you with the results.
OK.
OK perfect. Great.
OK, do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those give me a call, OK?
Either back pain, vomiting, great OK. Yeah, I'll watch out for those.
All right, OK. Have a good day. Thank you, bye bye.
OK, great thank you. You too, have a good day, bye bye.","**Clinical Note**

And your date of birth?
Oh nine two nine eighty-three.
OK, and your address for me please.
Two three one, Leonard, London street uh, sorry, London.
OK and that's correct, and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation.
Yes.
OK, uh, you've mentioned on our notes that you're suffering from bad diarrhea. I'm sorry to hear about it. So if you tell me a bit more about it, please.
Uh, it's been happening for about, three days now? Um, yeah it, started off uh, was, I don't know it's just something that I thought would go away pretty quickly.
OK.

I've had that from time to time after eating certain types of food or going on certain travels, but, uh nothing funky in my diet and no travels recently, um and it just kinda kept up. I'm a bit confused as to what to do .
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
So you haven't had anything from outside? Nothing dodgy anything ? No.
No, no no no, just a little bit, yeah I I don't know I mean it's pretty standard diarrhoea, where it's was like a little bit of abdominal pain. I threw up once, that was a little worrying, uh.

Mm-hmm.
Repeat that please, that wasn't clear. What did you say?
I threw up once, yeah.
After that we'd said something.
Uh, nothing else was worrisome.
OK, right, and with the diarrhea, how many times a day are you going to the toilet?
Uh, four to five.
Four to five times, yeah. And is there any? And it's like water? Is it like water or is it just loose?
Uh, what do you mean?
Are you going like water? Or is it just, you know bit, bit of solid stools, bit loose kind of thing?
It probably depends on the time of day to be honest, .
Sure OK. Bit of both and is there any blood or mucus?
No blood. What do you mean mucus?
It's like the snotty stuff.
In the stool?
Yeah, it looks like snot .
No.
No, so no mucus, OK. Any fever at all?
Uh, maybe a little bit, but.
Mm-hmm.
It hasn't been, that in particular hasn't been too worrying.
Are you still able to eat, and drink?
Uh, a little bit of.
Appetite loss I guess worse than normal, but also not something I've, like I, if that was alone I wouldn't have, reached out.
OK.
Sure. So but you're you're still able to drink quite a bit yeah? You're drinking plenty.
Yeah yeah yeah.
OK. Excellent.
Mostly it's been dry and red.
OK, and, um, what have you take, have you taken anything so far for the diarrhea?
Nothing yet.
Nothing yet, OK. Anything for the abdominal pain?
Uh, nothing yet.
OK. Right, and any unfortunately we don't have any of your past medical history, is there anything you'd like to say?
Uh, I.
Probably I I had asthma.
Mm-hmm.
Um or, or I don't know I guess I still have it.
OK and uh, are you, any, uh, anything else other than asthma?
Uh, my dad had hypertension.
OK.
Has hypertension. Had hypertension. Yeah he died of bowel cancer ten years ago.
Yeah .
Ohh dear, OK. Bowel cancer. Ten years ago. And how old was he when he died?
Uh, sixty-two.
K, and um, you mentioned you had asthma, are you using any inhalers at all?
Yes.
Which ones?
Lexapro.
Sorry?
Lexapro.
Laxepro.
Yes.
OK, not heard of it may. Is it like Salbutamol? Is it like a blue colour?
Yellow.
Yellow, OK. I'll have to check that one, not sure. Laxepro.
OK. Um, that's fine. Any other medication that you're using?
Over the counter, anything at all?
OK. Right. Any allergies?
No.
Nothing, yeah, nothing.
No allergies at all, righty . Fine so, obviously, you know you just have diarrhea it's about four to five times a day. Um, you're still drinking plenty and you look like you're not dehydrated which is a good sign, OK? Um, when we start worrying about diarrhea is if you're going more than eight times a day.
That means probably you are, you know, whatever you're eating is going straight through, OK? You still need to drink plenty of water because you're losing a lot of fluids.
Mmm.
OK, when you go to the toilet. Um, things that one would advise is a soft diet. So avoid dairy, fish, meat, eggs, while you're having the diarrhea. Go, sorry?
Soft .
What is a soft diet? What does that ? Like, outside of, not those things, what do you mean by soft?
OK, so that will be like crackers, toast, jam, those kind of things that's easily digested. Like what we are good give babies yeah. When they start eating you give, simple food for babies. You don't give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding. So that's the kind of soft diet we're talking about, yeah? Once you are able to, you know keep most of it in, you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash.
Once you're OK with that for about forty-eight hours then you can start having meat. So just don't have meat once you feel like you're slightly better, because you might go back to square one again, all right?

What do you mean OK with that diet, like once?
Forty-eight hours you're not having any diarrhea, you're fine then you can go and start having meat, egg, fish and all. So that .
OK, if if the diarrhoea is getting better but isn't getting, or do you want it to go away completely at that point, or if it's like trending upwards?
No, no, no preferably just don't because, what why do we say this? It's because it takes much more time for meat to get digested. So because your gut flora, you know, the, the, the bacteria in your gut is not you know as it should be, it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food.
While it doesn't take that much of an effort to, you know digest mash and vegetables. Does that make sense?
Yes.
Yeah? So, um, at the same time you could have some, although you can't milk is not a good idea, yoghurts are a good idea because they are probiotics, it help to build up the normal, um gut, gut bacteria back.
OK.
OK.
So those kinda, now, things to look out for, if your diarrhoea doesn't go away in a week's time, or if you're passing blood, we need a stool sample, because that means you you may have , um, some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics.
OK.
OK. If you're again, as I've mentioned previously if you're going about six to eight times a day, that means there's a high chance that, uh, you are, having dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time. If that happens you get in touch with us again, all right?
OK.
Any questions? You look a bit confused.
No, that's it.
Yeah? OK and also you could get something called Dioralyte over the counter. So, it helps to uh, replenish your, the salts that you've been, that's lost through going to the toilet.
OK.
OK? If you're a bit confused you know you can actually, uh, all this is all recorded in your app. So you can go back. I'll put that all in detail so if, you know I know sometimes it's a bit difficult to process everything, you can go back and read, read the notes.
Perfect, that's great.
Is that OK?
All right then, you take care.
Bye.
Bye now, bye bye.","**Clinical Note: ICF Rehabilitation Framework**

Yep.
Yes, I am. Yeah.
OK fantastic! So um, how can I help you today?
Um, yeah. I was, I was having, um, a bit of chest discomfort. So, I was doing some gardening, um, a couple of hours ago.
And I felt not exactly a pain but um like a a pressure on my chest, um, feels like someone sitting on my chest.
Um, and, I've noticed, um, a bit of nausea, not, no vomiting but, um, I'm pretty sweaty, um, short of breath, and it kind of feels like someone's sitting on my chest.
Right, OK.
Now, do you have those these symptoms right now or have they gone off now?
Um, no, they're still present.
OK. So, you've still got the chest discomfort right now?
Yes.
OK, um.
We're probably gonna have to call an ambulance for you.
OK. So what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna task my colleague next to me to sort that out. While we do that I'm gonna ask you a few more questions, OK?
OK.
Mmm, sure.
We're gonna a bit more information to the, to help the ambulance team when they, when they arrive, OK.
Sure.
So just to, just to double check, um, where exactly in the chest is the pain?
Um, it's in the, uh, middle of my chest, um, over, uh, yeah, my my pecs, so, um, yeah but not not necessarily to one side, um, and it's quite diffuse pain.

Is, is it spreading anywhere else, like down into your arm, up to the jaw, in your neck, anything like that?
Yeah. It's, it's, um, mainly in my left arm, er, it's feeling a little bit, um, er, painful, and, and in my shoulder as well.
Right, OK. Do you remember what you were doing at the time?

Uh yes, so it started uh just when I was gardening. So nothing that was too strenuous um I was just kneeling down and
Uh, yeah, wasn't running or anything, it wasn't during any physical exercise.
Sure, OK. And, and how much activity do you do normally? Do you walk a lot or do you run or do you do anything?
No, I don't, I, I generally don't do much activity at all, um, you know.
Have you had this before?
No, this is the first time, actually.
Right, OK. Can are you aware of any palpitations, like your heart beating faster or more prominently than normal?
Yeah.
Um, yeah. It's, it's beating a bit faster now. I think that's 'cause I'm a little bit stressed.
Um, about the situation but I haven't noticed it, um, beating faster than usual, um, and I did today.


So, I know you're stressed but, but we've got an ambulance coming on the way, OK? So um, we'll take care of everything, so don't, don't worry. Who's in the house with you at the moment?
Yeah.
OK, thank you.
Uh, no, no one's in the house at the moment.
OK. Um, and is your front door open?
Uh, yes, it's open.
OK so maybe we'll, we'll speak maybe in the hallway to the front door. Have the front door open so that, in case people need access, they could access you.
Yeah, yeah .
Alright. Um, so, um, uh, are you a smoker at all?
Uh, yeah, I smoke, um, a fair bit so I smoke about ten cigarettes, uh, a day. Um, yeah.

Yes.
Um, yes, so, my, um, father died of a heart attack, um, and my mother had some heart problems.

OK. Uh, I'm sorry to hear about your father. Can you remember what age roughly he was when he had, he had the heart attack?
Um, he was about my age.
Right so just under sixty, around sixty.
Yes, around sixty, yes.
Yeah, OK, alright. Um, do you drink much alcohol?
Um, yeah, I drink, um, about, per week, probably about seven or eight pints a week.
OK, is that a, a beer you're talking about, yeah?
Ohh. Yeah, yes.
Uh, I, I can't tell from the video, are you overweight?
Um, yes, I'm overweight, yeah.
Right, OK. Alright. Um, uh now um, you, do you normally live alone?
Yeah.
Uh, yeah. I live alone, uh, at the moment. Yeah, uh, it's just me in the house.
Sure, OK, and, and, uh, are you working at the moment?
Yeah yeah, I, I work, yeah.
Right, what do you work as?
Um, I work as a restaurant owner. So I own a sushi shop.
Right, OK. Alright. Um, so, um, the, the symptoms that you've described to me
Yeah.
Um, they indicate the possibility of, um, a heart attack.
OK? So, I'm not saying you definitely have a heart attack, but we, that, it's our number one priority to exclude that.
OK.
OK, so ambulance team will be with you very shortly. I'm gonna stay on the line with you until they come.
OK, yeah.
OK. when they come, what they'll do is, they're gonna put some stickers on your chest and do an ECG.
OK, yeah. Thank you.
And then decide where to take you after that, OK?
OK.
OK, no.
And um, what, what, uh, can I just double check? Do you have, um, any allergies to any medication?
Yes, actually, I have, um, an allergy to aspirin.
Right, OK.
Yeah, and no other allergies.
Sure. Uh, what's the nature of that allergy to aspirin? Do you, does it, does it cause you heartburn? Or is it like an allergic reaction?
Um
Yeah, uh, it's an allergic reaction, so I swell up, um, a bit, but, um, nothing life threatening.
Um, I've, I, sometimes even have it and it's, it's a, it's a mild reaction to it.
OK, all right. It's very important that you communicate that to the hospital.
Yeah.
Um, the detail you just told me, because, um, we, we may need to consider aspirin despite allergy, OK?
OK.
Ohh, OK.
Um, alright, um, now in terms of, um, what happens from here
OK.
That team will assess you and then they may take you into one hospital or another based on how bad , what the ECG looks like and what kind of treatment you might need, OK?
Uh huh.
Um, what I'm going to do is, we'll stay on the line for the time being, OK, until they come, and then, um, once they come, then I'll hand over to them and I'll explain what's going on, alright?
OK.
OK.
OK, OK, sure.
OK.
Yeah, thank you.
we'll end the conversation after the purposes. Is that OK?

Yeah, that's, OK. OK, thank you very much.
thanks! Bye!
Thank you. Bye.","**Clinical Note**

"Hi there, it's Doctor Smith from Babylon.
Hi.
Hi. Can you confirm you name, date of birth and your home address, please?
Uh, Sandra Bullock, uh, twentieth of February, nineteen fifty eight.
Hello.
And your home address?
Uh, seven three four, court in St. .
OK, that's fine. Uh, are you in a private place that you can have a consultation at the moment?
Yeah, yeah, I am.
OK, what can I do for you today?
Um, well, like five days ago I started having problems like a cough, and my nose is just constantly streaming.
OK. And, and are you normally fit and well?
Yeah, normally I'm diabetic, but other than that, like, generally pretty good.
Right, OK. So, just tell me about the last, did you say five days?
Yeah, five days or so ago.
OK. How about your cough at the moment?
Uh, it's quite bad. It's kind of quite dry, um.
I'm coughing maybe every twenty, thirty minutes or so.
OK, you bringing up any phlegm at all?
No.
No. Any chest pain?
No.
Chest what, sorry?
Any pain in your chest?
Uh, no.
Any difficulty breathing, feeling short of breath or any pain when you take a deep breath?
No, that's all fine.
Have you coughed up any blood or anything like that?
Nope.
And what about your nose symptoms?
Are you front of your sinuses or anything?
Uh, just .
Uh, nothing up in here but just constant streaming, like, using a million tissues.
OK. And any blood coming from the nose?
No, it's pretty green.
Right, OK. Any other symptoms, like sore ears? Sore throat?
Uh, I I've been feeling really hot, um, I don't know if it's fever as such, but, like, to touch I'm quite hot but sometimes I'm feeling really chilly, needing to be under a blanket, that sort of thing.
Have you checked your temperature with a thermometer?
Uhh, no, I haven't.
OK. Um, and are you eating and drinking normally?
Uhh, yes. Um, kind of around when it started, I had some diarrhoea, but I don't know if that was associated. But since then it's all been pretty fine.
OK. So, you're drinking well, holding down fluids OK?
Yeah.
And passing water OK?
Yeah, that's fine.
No vomiting, diarrhoea now?
No.
OK, that's fine. Um, any rashes that you've noticed?
Rashes? Uhh, no, nothing like that.
Yeah.
Any headaches or change in your vision?
No, um, I've had quite achy muscles, but that's pretty much it.
OK. And normally, do you have any chest problems?
Uh, no.
Do you ever get wheezing, short of breath?
Uh, I mean, like, if I do intense exercise, then yes. But not .
. And, do you regularly have any infections in your chest, or anything that needs treatment, normally?
No, uh, I've got hypertension, um, so I'm on some drugs for that, um, but that's it, really.
OK. Um, any other medical problems?
Uh, just the hypertension and the diabetes.
OK, and what type of drugs are you on?
Uh, I think something called metformin, and lisinopril I think is the other one.
OK, and when did you last have your blood pressure checked?
Uh, ooh, uh, a while ago. Um, .
Do you know if it, do you know if it's been stable?
Uh, I can't remember.
OK. And with your blood, with your diabetes, have you had a blood test recently?
Um, yeah. Like.
Yeah, it was normal. It was around three weeks ago.
OK, and do you know what dose of the lisinopril you're taking?
Uh, two hundred.
OK. Have you been able to pass water normally? Any increase in in frequency that you're passing water or any increased thirst?
Uh, no, not particularly.
And has your weight been stable?
Yeah.
What is your weight and height?
Uh, my height is five foot five, and my weight is sixty five kilograms.
OK. And do you smoke at all?

You drink any alcohol?
Yes, the odd cherry.
OK.Um, who do you live with at home?
Uh, my partner and my dog.
And do you work?
Uh, yes. I'm an office manager.
OK.
And have you been doing anything yourself to help with the symptoms? Anything that you've bought in the chemist?
Um, uh, a quite a few lemon sips. Um, they seems to be helping.

Do you, what, what do you mean by quite a few? How many in, in a day do you normally take?
Uh, maybe two or three. Maybe, like, at the start of the day and at the end of the day.
OK. Have you noticed any improvement in that?
Yeah. It tends to soothe my throat a bit for when I'm going to sleep.
OK. Um, do you have any allergies to anything?
Uh, I sometimes suffer from some, like, hay fever. But, um, but it's not bad
Any . Any allergies to any medications at all?
Not that I'm aware of, no.
OK. So, what you've described to me, it sounds like you, you probably have got an infection in the chest, um, because it's, it, you know, you're obviously getting symptoms of from your nose and your chest. Um, it sounds like you might have a high temperature, it's definitely worth getting a thermometer and checking your temperature.
OK. I can just get one of those at a pharmacy or something?
Yeah, and most of the time, these infections are caused by viruses, so they do normally settle by themselves. But it can take, you know, a week or two, um, and you can persistently have the cough ongoing longer than that.
Um, the important thing to do would be to take your temperature.
Um, and if you feel like, if the temperature's ongoing, above thirty seven point five, thirty eight, um, and you keep spiking temperatures and that's not settling down, or your cough's getting worse, you're coughing up lots of nasty phlegm or you cough up any blood or get blood coming out your nose,
um, or any shortness of breath, chest pain, then we certainly would need to speak to you again. With the diabetes you are a bit more likely to get a bacterial infection than if you didn't have the diabetes, so it's something we do need to be careful of.
OK.
OK. So, then we would at potentially antibiotics at that time, perhaps?
Yeah, potentially. If it is, if it's not settling or the temperature's ongoing, getting worse, then we definitely need to talk to you again.
OK.
Um, have you got any other questions?
Um, no, that's all fine.
It's fine to carry on what you're doing at the moment, with the lemsip. I wouldn't take, and that, that contains paracetamol so don't take any other paracetamol containing products, um, with that at the same time.
Yeah.
Um, the cough syrup isn't advisable in the daytime because it's best for your body if you just keep coughing. But if you're kept up all night and you can't sleep at all, then it, it's OK to have a little bit of cough syrup, just to settle that down.
OK. Cool.
OK? Do you have blood sugar checking equipment? Do you check? No, OK. Well, if you make sure that you have the regular diabetes and blood pressure checkups that your GP has asked you for?
Yep.
I'm not at home.
Yeah.
OK, great. Alright then, take care. Bye.

"[doctor] hi , cheryl . how are you ?
[patient] i'm doing well . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm doing well . so i know the nurse told you a little bit about dax . i'd like to tell dax about you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] cheryl is a 34-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension , who presents today with back pain . cheryl , what happened to your back ?
[patient] so i've been walking a lot lately . i've been walking to ... 30 minutes to an hour or so a day . and all of a sudden , um , when i was walking , my , um , back just kind of seized up on me . and i do n't really know what it was . maybe i was going a little bit faster . but it just all kind of clenched .
[doctor] okay . so you felt like , maybe like a spasm or something like that ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay . and how many days ago was that ?
[patient] that was about six days ago now .
[doctor] okay . and what have you taken for the pain ?
[patient] i've been taking ibuprofen . um , and then i've been putting some heat on it . but it's still pretty stiff .
[doctor] okay . all right . um , and did you have any trauma before that happened ? were you doing anything strenuous like crossfit or lifting boxes or anything like that before you went for , for the walk ?
[patient] i have been lifting more , um , probably around three times a week . so i do n't know if it was because i was doing deadlifts that day and then walked .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] um , maybe i was using my back more than my legs .
[doctor] okay . all right . and was it any particular area in your back ? was it the lower back ?
[patient] yeah , it was .
[doctor] okay . on one side versus the other ?
[patient] um , kind of both equally .
[doctor] okay . all right . and any numbing or tingling in your legs or your feet ?
[patient] no , i have n't felt anything like that .
[doctor] okay . any weakness in your lower extremities ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . all right .
and then in terms of your blood pressure , how are you doing ?
[patient] so i got that cuff that you suggested the ... our ... the last visit , and i've been doing readings at home . and that's been looking great , too . i've been watching my diet . again , my boyfriend's been great and dieting with me so i do n't have to do it alone . and everything's been good .
[doctor] okay . excellent . and you're taking the lisinopril ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . wonderful . okay . so i know you did a review of systems sheet with the nurse , and i know you endorse , you know , this back pain . um , do you have any other symptoms ? fever , chills , congestion , cough , chest pain , shortness of breath ?
[patient] i have a little bit of nasal congestion , but that's just from my seasonal allergies .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , let's go ahead . i want to do a quick physical exam on you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay ? hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . so good- you know , here in the office , your vital signs look great . your blood pressure's really well controlled , which is good . so that's a good job . so i'm going to take a listen to your heart and lungs . i'm going to examine your back , and i'm going to let you know what i find . okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay . all right . so on physical examination , you know , everything looks good . you know , on your heart exam , i do hear that slight two out of six systolic ejection murmur , but you've had that before . that seems stable to me . on your back exam , you do have some pain to palpation on the right lateral aspect of your lumbar spine , and you do have pain with flexion and extension as well , and you have a negative straight leg raise . so what does that mean ? so we're going to go over that . okay ? let's ... let me look at some of your results , though , first . okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] we did an x-ray before you saw me , so let's look at that . hey , dragon , show me the back x-ray . so looking here at this x-ray of the lumbar spine , everything looks good . there's good boney alignment . there's no obvious fracture , you know , which is not surprising based on your history . okay ?
[patient] hmm .
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the labs . and your labs that we did before you came in all look great . there's no elevated white blood cell count . there's no signs of infection . again , those are all really good . okay ? so let me go over with you about my assessment and my plan for you . so for your first problem , this back pain , i think you have a lumbar strain , and , you know , that might've happened , you know , lifting something or exercising . and so what i want to do is prescribe meloxicam , 15 milligrams once a day . uh , i want you ... you can ice the area , and you can also apply heat sometimes as well . um , you know , i'm going to refer you to physical therapy just to do some strengthening exercises of your back , um , because i do want you to continue to be able to work out and exercise . okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and for your last problem , your high blood pressure , again , everything looks great here . um , you know , i think you're doing a really good job with that as well . i want you to continue on the lisinopril , 10 milligrams a day . and then , uh , let me know if you notice any increases in your blood pressure readings . okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] do you need a refill of the lisinopril ?
[patient] yes , i do , actually .
[doctor] okay . hey , dragon ? order lisinopril 10 milligrams po daily . okay . uh , so the nurse will be in soon , and she'll get you checked out . okay ?

OK. So, um, can I, hypothetically, look into your mouth here?
Sure.
Yeah?
Yeah, so, uh, looking into your mouth

Um, you know, there's just a bit mild redness at the back of your throat. Um, there's no enlarged tonsils. Can you feel any glands around your neck, at all?
No. No.
No, I haven't had anything like that.
OK. So, it looks like, it's just a viral infection. Um, because it's just a cold and a cough. There's nothing there.
And generally if you have things like a chest infection, you would have a bit like a wheeze or shortness of breath.
So, um, things that we would recommend is you can use the, you know, Night Nurse, Day Nurse. It's still OK with your medications, yeah. So I'm, I'm sure that you are a bit wary to use them. But it's still OK with your current medication. You can still use that. Might be able to make you feel a bit more better quickly.
OK.
If there's any change, like you're feeling short of breath or be your symptoms are lasting more than three weeks or something
Or you're becoming poorly, uh, things like that, then you need to get in touch with us, then probably we might need to examine you and especially your chest. But I don't think so, that's necessary at this point in time
OK, that sounds good.
OK. Any questions at all ?
Uh, no, I I think that's been very helpful thank you.
OK. So just to round up, just use the night, Night Nurse, Day Nurse, if any change in your symptoms, like shortness of breath, wheezy, or symptoms are lasting more than three weeks, then get in touch with us.
OK, so I don't need any prescription, or anything like that.
No, no you don't need anything at the moment. OK. Take care, then. Bye. Bye bye.
OK.

"Hello.
Hello. Can you hear me?
Yeah, I can. Can you hear me?

Hi, my name is Doctor Gohill.
I'm one of, Hi, I'm one of the physicians that works at Babylon.

Are you in a quiet and private space to talk?
I am, yes.
Good, and can I confirm your name and date of birth please?
Uh, it's Joe Bloggs. It's the seventh, of June, nineteen seventy four.
Seventy four, and how old does that make you?
Sorry, fifty four . I'm, suppose I'd be fifty three, well, yeah.
Perfect.
Great, and it says here, um, it says you're having chest discomfort. Is that correct?
That, that is correct, yes. I'm experiencing discomfort in my chest.

OK, can you tell me a little bit more about your chest discomfort? When it started, and how you're feeling at the moment?
Sure, um, it's been ongoing for, a couple of hours now.
Um, I'd say that it's come on, quite suddenly. I was, digging in the garden.
And it, if I had to describe where it is, it's somewhere in the middle of my chest.
And it's more, it feels like it's pressure, discomfort, than more, than a pain.
Um, if I, had to .
If I, if I had to describe what discomfort feeling, it's, it's like someone's sitting on my chest. .
OK.
And.
Yeah.
Great. So, you've talked about your chest. Are you still in, discomfort at the moment?
Uh, yes I do smoke, yeah.
OK, and when it started, how would you rate it out, out of ten?
Say about, say, seven out of ten.
OK, .
Ten being, very sort of, unbearable and severe pain. Seven is.
Quite manageable, well, it's quite .
OK, and how about now?
Um, it's still the same.
OK, and tell me before this happened, what were you doing?
Yeah.
Um, I was, relaxing.
My wife, and, we're watching Jeremy Kyle.
OK.
still go out into the garden.
OK, and how often do you do gardening?
Um, every other week. So, fortnightly.
OK, and are you normally fit and well? So, are you normally OK to garden as you would?
Uh, yes.
Great, and apart from this, do you have any other medical problems?
Um, high cholesterol, and, I've had hypertension, hypertension.
OK, so that's high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Do you take any medicines for that?

No, I don't take any medicine.
OK, and are you allergic to anything?
Uh, .
OK. So, let me summarise what you've told me already. You were gardening a few hours ago, and you experienced chest discomfort, which was roughly seven out of ten.

And it feels more like someone's sitting on your chest, as opposed to pain.
Yeah.
Yes, that's great.
And apart from this, have you noticed anything else unusual, specifically with your breathing?
Uh, yes I have. Um, I've got shortness of breath. And I feel slightly, light-headed.
OK, and is that getting worse or better?
Um, it's remained the same. Although, I would say recently I've noticed, in terms of sort of breathing, I've had, some difficulty climbing the stairs. And, if I have to sort of walk uphill, there's that sort of challenge as well.
And when you get short of breath, when you're walking up the stairs, have you noticed any pain?
Um, no pain as such, but there's often calf pain and, leg swellings.
OK. So, let me confirm. You have the pressure at the moment, and you have shortness of breath, is that correct?
That is correct, yes.
. So, given what you've told me about your past medical history. I think it might be worth, you calling an ambulance.
OK.
get you to the hospital as soon as possible. Because, my concern is, it might be something to do with your heart.
So, While to you, I will ring an ambulance. Who, should come to your address.
Ohh, OK.
Ohh right.
But in the meantime, I think we should stay on the phone. So I can gather some more information, that we can give to the paramedics. Is that OK?
OK.
Um, should I, be concerned about anything?
It's nothing to worry about at the moment, but, given that you've got high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and you've got some chest pain. I'm always worried about the heart first, before anything else.
, OK, .
, and we, and we need to look after your heart before anything else.
So, apart from this light-headedness, and this chest discomfort, have you noticed anything else unusual?
Um, nothing, else unusual. Um, I'm not sure if I spoke to you about nausea?
I've noticed nausea, but no vomiting, yet.
Did you have anything to eat or drink this morning?
Um, no.
And you feel, still feel nauseous at the moment?
I have, yeah. I am, yeah.
So, I have a couple of other questions to ask you, and I'm gonna reel them off. So, apologies for not letting you talk very much.
OK.
No, that's fine.
Have you noticed this pressure, radiating to your head?
Uh, not to my head, no.
And how about to your left, or right arm?
Uh, yes. There is some pain in my left shoulder and arm.
And does that pain go anywhere else? To your left arm, or to your back?
Uh, no.
And, have you noticed any problems swallowing, or drinking water?
Uh, no.
Good.
And have you noticed any problems going to the loo?
Uh, no problems going to the loo.
And you're normally fit and well, apart from the two things you told me about?
Um.
Yes, however, there's some problems just, performing daily activities. Um, like I said, with the difficulties climbing up the stairs and going uphill. Um, I try to limit my daily activity to just moving around the house, nothing too strenuous.

And, do you live at home with your wife at the moment?
Uh, yes.
OK. I would suggest, if she's there, you let her know that, you'll both be having an adventure to the hospital today. So, she might need to get your things together.
OK.
Got it, OK.
The ambulance should be there very soon. In the meantime, I would suggest that you stay calm, and have some water if you need to.
OK.
Don't take any of those medications.
Right.
OK.
And the paramedics should be with you, very shortly.
All right.
So, when they do come, there are two things they will be worried about.
OK.
The one is your chest, so, your heart. And the second is your breathing, which is your lungs.
Yes.
OK.
So, they will give you lots of things to breathe through, and attach things to your arms. Just to check, things like your blood pressure, and your heart rate. So, don't be worried.
OK.
And, when you get to the hospital, you'll be seen by a consultant, pretty, pretty much immediately.
Yeah, .

Reassuring, I'm getting .
Sure. So, I will let the paramedics do their job. And when, you're at the hospital, the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes, to let me know how everything's going.
Ohh, that's great.
Great. I'll um, book another appointment, to see you soon. Uh, , once you've had your adventure.
OK.
That is perfect. Thank you so much.
No problems. Do you have any questions for me?
Uh, no questions. I'll just await the ambulance.
Great, thank you very much.
No problems. I'll speak to you soon.
Bye bye.
Thank you so much.
Bye.","**Clinical Note**

"Hi.
Hey.
Hi. Can you hear me?
Yeah. I can hear you.
Good. Um, my name is Doctor Gohil. I'm one of the physicians that works here at Babylon.
OK.
May I confirm your name and date of birth, please?
Uh, uh, my name is Sarah Smith. And, my date of birth is the twentieth of April nineteen eighty.

Great.
Nineteen eighty three. And, are you in a space that's private and quiet, and you can talk?
Yeah.

Yeah.
Good. So, it says, erm, I've got a note to say, it says you're feeling short of breath. Is that correct?
Yeah, yeah.
OK. Are you able to tell me a little bit more about that?
Yeah. I was watching TV and, um, just like over the last hour, I've started to feel, like, a bit short of breath.
That is, while you're sitting watching TV?
Yeah.
OK. And, have you noticed anything like this before?
Um, no.
OK. And, apart from the shortness of breath, have you noticed anything else?
Um, so, I , I started with a cough yesterday.
OK.
Um.
Yeah. I, I don't know if it's, um, relevant, but I had a C-section a few weeks ago.
OK. And, how long ago was that? Just a few weeks?
Yeah, four weeks.
OK. And, are you with baby at the moment?
Yes, I am.
And, how is baby doing?
Yeah. .
OK. Any coughs or colds with, uh, them?
No, no. He's fine.
OK. So, you've noticed shortness of breath for just an hour, while sitting and watching TV?
Yep.
Mm-hmm.
And, you had your C-section a couple of weeks ago?
Yeah.
And, yesterday you noticed a cough?
Yeah.
So, talk to me about the cough. Have you bought anything up?
Uh, no, I haven't, no.
And, when was the last time you were ill with the flu, or symptoms like this?
Um, you know, I get coughs and colds quite a lot, but probably.
Good few months ago.
OK. And, this shortness of breath you're having, is it getting worse?
Um.
No. I mean, I don't know. I feel like I'm getting really stressed out because, like, my heart, it's really going.
OK. So, you're feeling your heart more than normal?
Yeah.
And, the shortness of breath, does it cause any pain in your chest?
Um, no.
How about when you take a very deep breath in?
Um, I mean, yeah. My chest feels sore, but so does my C-section scar. You know, it's, it's all tender.
OK.
And, since your C-section, did you have to take any medications?
Um, no. Just some painkillers.
All right. And, can you remember what the name of those were?
Uh, they gave me some, uh, Codeine.
And, have you had to use that regularly?
Uh, yeah. I, I've been taking that fairly, fairly regularly. But, probably haven't taken it for a week.
OK. And, apart from the C-section and the shortness of breath, have you got any other medical problems I should know about?
Yeah.
Um, no.
And, you were .
tell you, I'm allergic to Ibuprofen, though.
OK.
And, what happens when you take Ibuprofen?
Um.
I don't know. Sorry.

So, I need you to do something for me. Have you measured the rate of your heart before?
Uh, yes.
Have you measured it recently, either with an iWatch or something similar?
No, I haven't, no.
OK. We might need to do that over the phone. So, are you able to put your right hand on your left wrist, just underneath your thumb? And, see if you can feel your heartbeat.
Yep.
Yep.
So, uh, what I need you to do is, when I count to three, count down from three, just count the number of beats you've noticed. And, I'll tell you when to stop. Is that OK?
Mm-hmm.
Yep.
So, we'll start in three, two, one. Go.
Great. That should be enough. How many did you count?
Uh, I counted thirty.
Good.
So, your heart is running slightly fast at the moment, which is probably because of the shortness of breath and some of the pain that you're under.
Mm-hmm.
OK.
Given that you've had a C-section, and you're short of breath, which has come on quite recently and quite quickly
It might be worth you going into the hospital to get checked out the bit further.
OK.
So, there's two ways of us doing this. The first is, I can call an ambulance. Or, you can take yourself to the hospital with baby.
Mm-hmm.
Which one would you prefer?
Uh, it feels a bit dramatic to call an ambulance. Um, I, I will, I will go. I will, I will take myself.
Sure. And, what I would suggest is, go fairly quickly and take some bits for baby at the same time.
OK.
And, if you're taking any medications like Codeine, don't, don't take them for the time being.
Mm-hmm, OK.
Is anyone else with you at home?
Uh, no. My partner's at work.
OK.
So, I think that's the best thing to do, for the time being.
Mm-hmm.
So, what I'm worried about at the moment is, given that you've had a C-section
Some people can suffer with clots. And, those can either be found in the legs or your chest, so in your lungs.
Yeah.
It's quite a common thing to happen. And, it's not something to worry about. But, needs to be checked out in the hospital first.
OK.
And, if it, if that does become the case, they can give you something to reduce the clot.
All right, OK. That makes sense.
Fairly quick process.
OK. Yeah. I mean, my mum's had, uh, clots in her legs before. So, I guess, you know.
Yeah, that makes sense. I know, I know what they are.
Good. Are you, uh, are you particularly worried about anything, or do you want to ask me anything, before we go?
No, no. I'm fine. I'll, uh, I'll just take myself to the hospital.
Great. Thank you so much.
All right. Thank you. Bye.","**SBAR Clinical Note**  

**Situation**:  
Patient, Sarah Smith, 32-year-old female, presents with acute shortness of breath (SOB) of 1 hour duration, occurring while sitting and watching TV. She also reports a new cough starting yesterday. No chest pain, but chest soreness and tenderness at C-section scar (4 weeks postpartum). Heart rate measured at 300 bpm (30 beats in 10 seconds) via self-count. No prior history of SOB.  

**Background**:  
- **Medical History**:  
  - C-section 4 weeks ago; postoperative pain managed with Codeine (used regularly for ~1 week, discontinued).  
  - Allergic to Ibuprofen (unknown reaction).  
  - No prior history of chest pain, pulmonary issues, or chronic respiratory conditions.  
- **Current Symptoms**:  
  - SOB worsened by stress, with increased heart rate and chest discomfort.  
  - Cough without fever, sputum, or other cold symptoms.  
  - No recent flu-like illness.  
- **Medications**:  
  - Codeine (discontinued for ~1 week).  
  - No other medications.  

**Assessment**:  
- **Acute SOB** with elevated heart rate (tachycardia) and chest tenderness raises concern for **pulmonary embolism (PE)**, given recent C-section (risk factor for venous thromboembolism).  
- **Chest soreness** and **C-section scar tenderness** may be related to postpartum healing, but **no chest pain** or hemoptysis rules out cardiac or pulmonary causes.  
- **Allergy to Ibuprofen** noted; no other contraindications identified.  
- **No evidence of acute respiratory distress** or cyanosis, but **urgent evaluation** is required to rule out PE or other complications.  

**Recommendation**:  
1. **Immediate hospital visit** for further assessment (e.g., D-dimer, chest X-ray, ECG, ultrasound of lower extremities).  
2. **Avoid Codeine** until evaluated; discontinue all analgesics pending provider guidance.  
3. **Transport with infant**; ensure baby is brought to hospital.  
4. **Monitor symptoms** for worsening SOB, chest pain, or dizziness; seek emergency care if symptoms escalate.  
5. **Document allergy to Ibuprofen** and Codeine use in medical records.

And I don't know what's causing them. I have googled it and, um, nothing's coming up, so I thought I'd come and speak to you about it.
OK.
OK. So, tell me a bit more about these weird symptoms you've been having.
So, it started with, feeling very tired, but for a couple of days, and then I get back to normal.

And then I started losing feeling, in my hands and arms. I get a weird sensation like, uh, I guess, pins and needles.
Right again, the connection's not so great. You've been getting pins and needles in the hand. Is that right?
And.
Yeah, that's correct.
OK. Is that the right or left hand?
My right hand.
Is it always the right?
Yes.
OK. Um, we've lost video now, maybe is there a, a, a button you can press?
OK.
Are you happy for us to carry on without the video? I can't see you at the moment.
Yes, that's fine.
All right. Um, so, you've been having these pins and needles, and episodes of numbness, in the right hand. Is it just the hand, or does it go up the arm as well?
Uh, the pins and needles are in the hand, but I feel like my arm is getting weaker, but it only lasts few days and then goes back to normal. So, it's very weird.
Right, OK. Um, is there any involvement of your leg at all?
Uh, my, colleague said, I'm walking slightly differently to normal.
And again, it's only for three days, or three or four days.
OK. You, you said you've been having weird symptoms for about a month.
Yes.
, so, what has been happening from the beginning of the month? What else has been happening?
Um, I generally feel tired, and weak.
And, sometimes I feel nauseous, and I don't feel like I want to do anything.
Right, OK.
Um, and, um.
You know, , your colleague said you've, you've not been walking normally.
Yes.
Do you feel anything different, on either side, in terms of your legs? Can , have you noticed anything different?
Yeah, so, at the same time I get my arm symptoms, my leg feels weaker.
Right, OK.
And.
You know you, the abnormal gait. Has that been present, outside of these episodes?
No, it has not. So normally, I'm, fit and well actually.
Right, .
All right, OK. Um, and, these, these episodes. How often have they been happening?
They have been getting more regular. So at the start, it would be maybe once a week, uh, to every once , once a month, but now it's getting uh, uh, a couple of times a day.
Right, OK. And, how long have these episodes been going on for? When, when did it all start? Was it a month ago?
, probably a month and a half, maybe two months.
Right, OK.
OK. And, along with these symptoms, of the weakness and numbness. Do you have any other symptoms at the same time? Like swallowing, or difficulty speaking, or vision problems?
So, recently I've noticed, I can't hold my cup of coffee.
And when I, do drink coffee, it's slightly harder to drink.
And that's only been in the last couple of days, I guess.
Right. Is that during these episodes, or outside of these episodes?
Only during the episodes.
OK.
Do you have any difficulty swallowing at all?
Not currently, no.
. During the episodes, do you have any difficulty swallowing?
I, I, I feel like there's something in my throat.
OK. What about, um, difficulty speaking during these episodes? Any, any issues with that at all?
No, I can speak fine.
OK. And any visual problems during these episodes?
I, I don't think so, but I wear glasses.
OK, all right. Now um, can I just ask? , has, uh, is there any history of stroke, or mini-strokes in your family?
Uh, yes. My, father has had a, operation to the side of his neck, to reduce the risk of stroke.
Right, OK.
Um, and, uh, how about yourself? Have you had any history of, mini-strokes or anything like that, along those lines? I know you're quite young.
No, so after my, dad had his operation, I was required to be checked, and my cholesterol , was fine.
Good, excellent. So you had a, a blood test done. And did they check for diabetes as well?
Yeah.
They checked my diabetes, my blood pressure and my, cholesterol, and the doctor said it was all OK.
Fantastic, OK. Now, do you have any other illnesses at all?
No.
No. Are you on any medication?
I take an aspirin, seventy five milligrams, once a day, but that's, because of something I read on the internet.
OK. So, so, why is that? Why do you take that?
I think it's, meant to reduce your risk of stroke and heart attack.
OK. Do, have you ever told a doctor before, your GP, that you're on Aspirin?
Yes I took, I started to , taking it after my, father had his operation, but that wasn't the doctor telling me.
OK. Uh, and, has any GP ever spoken to you about, the risks of Aspirin, and whether you should be on it? Or have you not , told the , the GP in the past?
No, I haven't.
You haven't, OK. Um, all right. Um. Now, um, in terms of your uh, your kind of social situation. Um, are you working at the moment?
Yes, I am.
, what do you work as?
Uh, I'm, uh, I'm actually a doctor.
You're a , a, a medical doctor?
Yes.
OK. Uh, which, specialty are you in?
I work in, uh, plastic surgery.
Plastic surgery, OK, great. And, um, do you, have any, um, allergies to any medication at all?
I'm allergic to penicillin only.
OK. And, um, are you, um, living alone?
No, I live with my wife.
Right, OK. Um, fantastic. Uh , do you smoke at all?
No, I don't.
Right, OK. Um, that's fine. Now, obviously you're a, you're a medic yourself. Did you have any thoughts as to what might be going on?
Uh, I've actually, got no idea.
Right, OK. Um, well the, the way you're describing these episodes. They make me concerned about, mini-strokes or TIAs, , transient ischemic attacks. Um.
OK.
And so, that's something quite urgent. And given that you've got a family history of um, stroke.
Um, even though you're quite young, I think um, it's something that we need to exclude. So, what I'm probably going to do, uh, in fact what I am going to do, is I'm going to, refer you to a stroke, a TIA clinic.
Um, now just to double-check. Do you have the symptoms right now?
No, I'm perfectly fine at the moment.
OK. So, so, what I'm gonna do, is I'm uh, I'm gonna refer you to a, a mini-stroke clinic, or a TIA clinic.
Um, I send that referral off now, and then you can attend them, they, they'll usually, call you in within the next one to two days, OK.
Because it's something relatively urgent. Now, today it's Wednesday, so we've got a few days , before the weekend. So, um, uh, basically the deadline should be, Thursday, Friday.
We're expecting you to be seen by the time, that's the kind of turnaround we're, we're looking at.
And in that clinic, they'll be doing a number of things. Um, they'll be checking, they'll be doing a ultrasound of the, carotid arteries, like your, your father had. Um, and, they'll be doing a, maybe a, they might do a scan of your brain as well, to check if there's any signs of a bleed there.
But, um, they'll be doing a range of tests in a short time frame, in order to exclude whether, you have um, any illness. OK, whether you have got any kind of stroke or, mini-stroke.
Sure.
Now, if your symptoms return and they persist, they're prolonged. Then um, you may need to attend A and E.
OK, because um, our presumptive, working diagnosis is, mini-stroke or TIA, OK.
And if, a mini-stroke is prolonged then uh, then we end up thinking that this might be a stroke and in that case, that becomes even more of an emergency. So, we're not talking about waiting one or two days, we want you to go to hospital in that instance, as soon as possible, OK.
Sure.
Now if , things happen again, feel free to contact us, we can assess you over the phone, we can give you direction and guidance over the phone. That's, that's, that's not a problem, you know, you, you've got easy access to us.
OK. So, um, this is the plan going forward. Um, I'm going to, um, do that referral.
You should hear back from the hospital, relatively soon.
The hospital, you can actually ring them, on um, uh, the PALS number, and then there's also the TIA clinic number.
I'm going to leave that number in the notes for this consultation, OK. So you'll have all the information you need, to chase this appointment.
OK.
And um, if you want, you can ring them, either today or tomorrow morning.
, today in the afternoon, wait uh, one or two hours. Or tomorrow morning just to find out when they got time to slot you in. And, just to make sure they've got you in the system, that they've got in the books, and they're going to be calling you in, OK.

, this isn't, a, an immediate emergency that you need to rush down to A and E. But it's something quite urgent we need to, deal with in a short space of time, OK.
So if there's, if there's any delay that, transpires for example, you can't make the appointment or, you know, they, you don't get called. , you, you get, get in contact back, back with us, OK.

All right. Did you have any questions at all?
No, I think that covers, most of it.
OK, great. So just bear with me a few minutes, and then I'll send that uh, all through and then you should, um, you should be able to help, you should have the information at your hands to, in order to take things further, OK.
, thank you.
All the best. Take care now. Bye bye.","**Clinical Note**

"Ah.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi, uh, my name is Doctor Kumar. I'm one of the GPs here. Can I just get you to confirm your name and date of birth for me, please?
Uh, yeah, I'm Maria.

Yeah.
Date of birth?
Sorry?
And your date of birth?
Um, twenty second uh, of March, of um, ninety.

Again, how can I help today?
Um, so, I'm having like a really, really strong headache. I don't know what is happening. I'm, quite concerned.
So, it started in the morning. Um, I feel like um, uh, dizzy. Uh, my vision is a little bit blurred. Um, like, it's, it's really painful, and I'm getting really concerned. Especially because I'm having like these, uh, changes in the vision.
OK. So, it started this morning, was it a sudden onset headache, did it come on suddenly?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
OK. And did it come on really bad or did it start off, uh, like a slight headache and build up to a, a severe headache?
Uh, it came like, kind of suddenly.
And if , if ten is the worst pain you've ever felt in your life, how bad would you say the pain was between one and ten?
Well, I had the kidney stone, so let's say that that's ten. Um, I have now, , maybe five, well, six, six probably.
It's not ten. Great!
But, it's more about me being really concerned, because this is very weird.
OK. No, that's fine. Have you ever had a headache before?
Sorry?
Have you ever had a headache like this in the past?
Um, well not, really.
OK. So, it's a first .
Like this, I, yeah, like this, no, definitely. It's something new.
OK. OK. If you had to say where uh, uh, across the head, uh, the headache is, is it across the front, around the back?
It's in uh, one side, uh, the left side, only.
And tell me what visual problems are you getting?
My vision is quite blurred. Um, it, it's, it's really weird, like some zigzag lines.
OK.
Kind of. I don't know how to describe it properly.
OK. And, um, have you tried any painkillers for this already?
Yeah, I tried Paracetemol, but uh, didn't work. To be honest, I feel exactly the same.
OK. Um, OK. Um, what time did you take the paracetamol? How long ago was it you'd taken it?
Uh, well, uh, the headache started like four year, four hours ago. So, I would say like, maybe three hours ago, because I couldn't stand it.
OK. Um, and your visual problem is still ongoing now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel a little bit, a little bit better. , I cannot stand screens.
Um, but, yeah, definitely. And, when I move, like the thing is that if I, if I leave bed, I start to feel like, even worse if I move.
So, I just want to have my hay, my head like really, uh, not moving.
OK. OK, Um, so, what about, , have you felt sort of nauseous or like you want to vomit?
Ohh yeah. Ohh, I forgot to mention, definitely, I vomit twice.
Actually, as soon as the, the headache started, I also vomited. So, initially, I thought it was something that I ate, but then the headache started to be really bad, and I still feel nausea.
Still feel.
To be honest, I'm about to vomit, very soon, I think.
All right. OK. You've mentioned, in the past, you've had kidney stones, any other medical problems?
Sorry?
Uh, you've mentioned that in the past, you've had kidney stones. Have you had any other medical problems in the past?
Yes.
Uh, so, uh, uh, not actually. Uh, my mother has migraines. I'm not sure if that's relevant?
And uh, also, I have hypothyroidism in the family.
So, it might be. I don't know, uh, I've, I don't know.
, what else do you have in the family?
I think we are losing connection. Sorry, I, I think we lost connection.
Ohh, can you still hear me? Ohh, it's gone. You can hear me. Um, you said, you mentioned your mother has migraines. What else do you have in the family?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Hypothyroidism.
Hyperthyroid
. She also has Hypothyroidism.
OK. Bye. OK. Um, and no other relevant family history?
Uh, no, not that I'm aware.
And do you take any regular medications?
Uh, no.
Are you allergic to any medications?
Not that I'm aware, uh.
Yeah, not that I'm aware.
OK. Is there any chance you could be pregnant?
Uh, I really doubt it.
Fine. And so, you're not allergic to any medications. Fine from.
And what, what were you thinking might be going on? I know you seemed quite worried about it. Was there anything in particular you were worried about?
Well, I'm a little bit hypochondriac. So, I feel that this can be some kind of brain tumour, tumour or something? Because, I'm like this is, , really, the pain is so horrible that, or maybe a stroke. I don't know, it's, it's just like you know, you hear so many stories.
That, you definitely start wonder, if i should go to A and E urgently, because , I might really have something serious.
OK. OK, fine. Um, now just, uh, another, uh, question, have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs, anything like that?
No, no , no, no.
Uh, and when you're walking, you're able to walk fine in a straight line or is your, your uh walk, are you walking a bit funny?
Uh, not really.
OK.
It's really about the head. That's why I find it very weird.
OK. So, just, just to clarify what, what you said . This morning, uh, you woke up and then later on in the, in the morning, about four hours ago, you've developed a headache?
Um, on the left side of the head?
Yep.
Yeah.
Left side of the head, is it behind the eye?
Exactly.
Sorry?
Is it behind the eye? Is that where the pain is?
Uh, no, no it's, ugh, I don't know how to describe it. But it's, just like, , kind of.
Um, you've .
OK. That's fine. You've noticed that your vision is blurry, there's funny lines, you feel a bit nauseous, you vomited twice.
Um, and, uh, you feeling dizzy as well, but your, you've got no neurological symptoms. You're walking fine.
Yes.
Um, and, and you've taken paracetamol and it hasn't helped. Is that all? OK.
No.
So, it sounds like what you're suffering from is what's known as a migraine. Is that something you've heard of before?
Yeah.
Uh. Uh, no, it's the first time.
OK.
But, to be honest, I'm very familiar with the disease, because my mother has it, so.
Uh, well, but I never had it, and I thought that the onset of migraine will be, you know, in much, uh, early ages. So, that's why I'm not sure, if migraine makes sense. .
OK. So, um, usually with, with migraines they can present at different times in people's lives, so, sometimes they can present as a child, sometimes they can present when they're older.
Um, and sometimes they can present, you know, even postmenopausally.
So, there's different, there's different ways you can get migraines. Uh, and the reason why this sounds like migraines is because it's on one side of the head.
typical of a migraine, you've got blurry vision, again which is very typical, with the nausea and vomiting, that's also typical of a migraine.
Mm-hmm.
Now, um, uh, obviously, if the headache is really severe, and I'll suggest some medications you can try, if that doesn't work, we would want to see you, um, as soon as possible, to do like a full neurological exam as well.
to make sure that, you know, there's, you know, when we do a more specific examination that, um, everything all seems fine.
Ohh, that's great.
Um, I I would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you, uh, if you take some medications, maybe something like ibuprofen?

Yeah.
OK. So, and, uh, you're, you're saying that if this is a migraine, and if I try that medication. This should go away, kind of, today?
So, yes, a migraine, yeah, no, you know, even sooner than that, we can look at maybe half an hour to forty minutes, depending on what your response to it is, for some people,
Uh, whatever medications they take the migraine doesn't improve, um, and they can last from anywhere from four hours to seventy two hours, migraines can last. Um, but .
Ugh. OK. That doesn't sound good.

No. So, what, there's lots of medication treatments so, there's, it can be ibuprofen with an anti-sickness, um, so and , which you can get from the pharmacy.
Um, and you also to drink, uh, sugary and carbonated drinks, something like Coke.
OK.
For the three of them is, uh, is a good sort of cocktail to start them, then we can go up the treatment ladder, you can get specific migraine relief medication.
And that should be something to try between now and when we see you to do the, um, to do the assessment.
OK.
OK. Sounds.
assessment to where we can see you today at some point.
OK.
And, but however, if you do take these medications and, you know, by the time your appointment time comes in and you feel much better in yourself, you can cancel it, um, you can give us a call and cancel it.
OK, sounds good, yeah. Sounds, sounds a good plan.
OK.
Uh, any, any questions for me?
Uh, no, thank you very much. You were very helpful.
All right. OK. Um, any, any further problems between now and your appointment, please do let us know.
OK, yeah. Thank you very much.
OK. Bye.

[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . good , here in the office , everything looks great with your vital signs . i think that's great , so i'm just gon na take a listen to your heart and your lungs , and take a look at your elbow and , and we'll go from there , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , so , so on physical examination of your left elbow , you do have some erythema and edema of your left elbow . does it hurt when i touch ?

[doctor] okay , he ... she has some pain to palpation of the olecranon . of the left olecra- olecranon , and it is warm to palpation . um , can you straighten your elbow for me ?
[patient] yeah , it , it hurts , and it's , uh , it's a bit stiff .
[doctor] okay , so she has pain with flexion and extension of the left elbow . there's a palpable right ... or s- ... palpable left radial pulse . okay , um , so let's go over ... i just wan na take a look at some of your results , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the left elbow x-ray . hey , dragon , show me the elbow x-ray . hey , dragon , show me the left arm x-ray . okay , so , in reviewing the results of your left arm x-ray , there's no evidence of any elbow fracture , which is not surprising , okay ?
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the endoscopy results . hey , dragon , show me the endoscopy . okay , well , your recent endoscopy showed that you ... hey , dragon , show me the endoscope . all right , so here it looks like , you know ... your endoscopy results look like you had an episode of gastritis . that's for your , your peptic ulcer disease , and so everything , you know ... you took your , your protonix , and i think everything resolved at that point , okay .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you . so for your first problem , this left elbow pain , you know , i think you have olecranon bursitis , and we're just gon na , you know , have you , you know , get a little pillow for your elbow there . it's just caused by repetitive trauma .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so , maybe you're slamming your elbow down a little bit on the desk , so just get a little rest there-
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] . and we'll give you some melo- meloxicam , 15 mg , once a day . you can ice the area , okay ? um , for your next problem , the epilepsy , sounds like you're doing really well . i would go ahead and continue with the keppra , 500 mg , twice a day . do you need a refill of that ?
[patient] yes , i do .
[doctor] hey , dragon , order a refill of keppra , 500 mg , twice daily . for your third problem , the depression , it sounds like you're doing well with the therapy and , if you want , we can talk about medical treatment options .
[patient] yeah , i think that would be great .
[doctor] okay , well , let's go ahead and we'll start you on some lexapro , 10 mg , once a day , and we'll see how you do on that , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , and then , for your last problem , the peptic ulcer disease , um , i want you to continue on the protonix , 40 mg , once a day before meals , okay ?

"Hello?
Hello? Hello. Um, before I go any further, can I confirm your name and your date of birth?
Uh, yeah. Uh my name is April, and I'm fifty.
You're fifty, OK. April, how can I help you this afternoon?
Well I've just been having this like, cough, for quite a few days. And my nose is running. Um and it's just been super annoying, and it's not going away.
, OK. When did it all start?
Uh I think it started like maybe, a bit less than a week ago. Like maybe, maybe five or six days ago.
OK. And you mentioned a couple of things there. You mentioned a cough. You mentioned a bit of a runny nose. Is that right?

OK. Let's focus on your cough first. Can you tell me a bit more about your cough?
Uh, it's just so continuous. It's really, really frustrating. It's quite dry. And it's just all day, it like keeps me up at night as well, which is really annoying.
OK. So it's a dry cough. So you're not bringing up any , you're not bringing up any mucky, ohh I can hear that, yeah. Um you're not bringing up any uh, mucky phlegm or anything like that.
No, OK. So it keeps you up at night. Um you mentioned uh the cold symptoms as well, the runny nose. Do you have a do you have a sore throat at all?
I mean, apart from, I mean the coughing is giving me a sore throat. But it's not like, you know not more than, than that. You know just, just my throat is irritated from coughing. But it's not like, it's not that bad when I swallow or anything.

Right. Do you have any uh, how are your ears? Do you ears feel blocked or?
No.They feel OK, actually. Yeah. . Nothing, nothing on the ears.
No pain, no discharge coming from your ears.

OK, alright. Um fine. In terms of your breathing, how is your , how's your chest? Is your breathing more labored?
Um, I don't think so. Like, I guess I get laboured when I'm coughing and I can't breathe. But I, not, yeah, not, I, I don't think so. Not really.
Day to day when you walk around, uh you don't feel breathless do you?
I don't feel restless. No, I feel you know, generally tired.

OK. OK.
So like, yeah, but not, not anything special with my chest.
Any pain in your chest?

No not, not that either.
OK. You mentioned feeling tired. Um have you felt feverish at all? Have you had a temperature?
Um I've been having like, like shivers, even when I'm in, when I'm in bed.
You know like, when you, when you go to sleep and, and you feel like I I should be warm. But I'm still, still you know, shivering a little bit.

OK.
But I haven't taken my temperature, so I'm not a hundred percent sure if I had a fever. But it feels like I probably did. 'Cause I was just, I was next to my boyfriend. And he was completely warm and totally fine. And I just like couldn't stop shivering. And kept adding more sweaters on, and I was still cold.


OK. OK. OK. Alright. Um, fine. And in terms of any other symptoms, so have you had any nausea? Have you had any vomiting?
No. No, no nausea. No vomiting. Like, um yeah, nothing like that.
OK.
How's your appetite?
Um, I mean it's OK. I, at the beginning, like when I was starting to have the , the , the coughing and stuff.
Um, I had a little bit of diarrhea. Um but, but it didn't, it didn't cut my appetite or anything. I just like, my stomach wasn't feeling great.


OK. Has that got better now, the diarrhea?
Yeah, yeah. It got better. It was only like the first, like it started at the same time as the cough started. And then it stopped. So I thought everything would be fine. But then the cough just kept going.


OK fine. Um, any problems with your waterworks at all?

With my what?
Uh your your waterworks, your urine.

Ohh. Uh, no. No no, it's fine.
you're passing urine OK. You're drinking plenty of fluids, and passing urine OK.
No. I, I drank loads of water, when I started having the diarrhea. Now that it stopped, I just went back to normal.
OK, alright. Um in terms of any other thing, do you notice any, any find any skin rashes, or um problems with your muscles or joints?
Uh like my, you know when I had the, when I was telling you I had like the, I had chills, and I was really cold. My muscle was really hurting.
Yeah.
OK.
Sometimes I do pilates. But like, it's hurting me so much at the moment. Um so, to be honest, all I feel like doing is just lying in bed.
Right.
Right, OK. OK. I'm sorry. That must be very difficult for you.
Yeah, right. Especially like in my arms, my legs, like just everywhere basically.
quite lethargic and weak, you mentioned. Um, OK. And um, April are you normally otherwise fit and well?
Yeah, pretty much.
Am I normally what?
Uh fit and well. So do you have any other medical history?
Uh, well I have type two diabetes. And I have quite high blood pressure.
OK.
OK. And what do you take for your blood pressure? Any, or what what medications do you take on a regular basis, if you don't mind saying?
Um I take Metformin for the diabetes. And I take Lisinopril for the high blood pressure.
Yep.
Zinopril. OK, fine. Any allergies at all, to medications?
No. No allergies.

No, OK. Regarding any family history, is there anything I should be aware of?
Uh my dad also has type two diabetes. But I think that's it.
OK, alright. Who's looking after your diabetes? Is there anyone, is there a doctor in a hospital, who looks after your diabetes?
I just regularly go see a doctor.
Um, that just checks up on it. Same with the high blood pressure. Like I, I have it under control. And since I've started taking this medication, I've just been like regularly checking that it, it's under control.

Right, excellent. And in terms of your social situation, who lives at home with you?
Uh just, it's just me and my partner.
lives OK, um fine. Is your partner well at the moment?
Yeah he has none of this. Like he's just going ahead like, like nothing. Like I was a bit worried that I would pass it to him but, not uh, diarrhea, nothing, fine.
Right, OK. So he
Go away, he's got away with it, at the moment. OK. And uh, are you working at the moment, April?

Uh, yeah I am working. But the, the first day I skipped. because I was feeling just too shit. Um, but then, I just felt like had to go back, 'cause I had so much to do. So I've been going in. But it's not been fun.
Yeah.

No, I can imagine. What is it that you do for work?
Uh, I am a developer.
Ohh, so you work in the IT field. OK. IT field. Right, OK. Uh
yeah. Work in IT.
not too active a job. Uh, yeah.
No. Has it been quite stressful recently?
Not more than usual. I don't think it's related to stress. Like I, I don't feel like I've had a particularly hard time at work that way. Um
OK.
The reason I ask is sometimes
I've been able to take a day off to try and recover. So yeah, I don't think it's related.
Sure. reason I ask is because sometimes stress can really affect your immune system. Um but uh it's good to know you're you're you're not feeling stressed.
Um, do you smoke at all, April?
I used to, but I've stopped for about six months now.
OK. Um and what about alcohol?
I mean, yeah I, I don't think I drank that much. Like, I I don't really know how you count the units. So I guess like I don't drink more than like, like, let's say three evenings a week? And I rarely get like properly drunk, or anything.
And what is it that you drink?
Wine, mostly.
The wine. How much do you drink on those nights?
Uh, I'd say like maybe two or three glasses.
OK. So um, yeah so you're probably just about under the limit of um, the recommended limit.

Something think about, just in terms of your blood pressure and diabetes, maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can.
Yeah? I should cut down on it.

really ideally, the the the right answer is to cut down completely. But so in practice I know that's not realistic. So maybe for the first few weeks, why don't you cut down to two glasses a week. And then, one week thereafter
Um and if you are coping OK, then you can maybe try and cut down altogether.
OK.
OK? Just something for you to think about. Um, right so uh just as we wrap up really, um April I think based on your story, I think uh essentially I think you're, you're going through a bit of a bit of a viral illness. Um, I don't think there's anything to worry about.
Yeah.
You know you've had a bit of a cough, bit of a runny nose, feeling quite weak and lethargic.
I'm hoping that, you know, you're probably over the worst of it now. It's been five days. I'm hoping you're maybe going to get better in the next couple of days. It normally lasts for about a week to ten days.
What, what should I do if it just keeps going on and on? Like if it's still going on in, in say four days?
Yeah, absolutely. So, you know things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to, you know get some nice, good rest.
Drink plenty of fluids. Keep yourself well-hydrated. You can take regular Paracetamol.
If you feel like you're still not getting any better in two to three days, it's probably worth coming back to see me again. We can check you over.
And if you are still feeling feverish, um and your cough isn't getting any better, then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest. some of the uh uh common source of infection. Um
Do you think I should keep going to work? Or do you think I should just
Yeah so I think you know , really I think it depends on you. it's um if you are coughing, then there is a theoretical, you know risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still. So I would say maybe take a day or two off work, if you can.
Uh and get some good bed rest. Um and maybe think about work early next week.
OK. OK. Thank you.
But um, if your cough isn't getting any better, or your breathing is getting worse, I want you to come back and see me sooner. OK?
OK. But otherwise, I don't need to worry.
No no no , nothing to worry about otherwise.
OK. Alright. Thank you very much.
OK. Well, have a good day. Appreciate it.
Thank you. Bye!","**Clinical Note**

[doctor] anytime i move it do you remember falling
[patient] no i do n't think so but my kid got pretty rough with me and was checking me several times with a sick
[doctor] okay
[patient] so i could have got hit there
[doctor] okay alright yeah that that that definitely makes sense so how would you describe the pain is it like a dull pain is it stabbing what what would you say
[patient] it it's a pretty sharp pain
[doctor] okay
[patient] anytime i move
[doctor] okay and does it radiate down your arm or does it stay in that one spot
[patient] it radiates down the forearm
[doctor] radiates down the forearm alright so have you taken any medications for it to make it better
[patient] i tried taking advil couple of days but i usually just forget about it
[doctor] okay when you took it did it did it help at all did it change your your pain score
[patient] yeah i i think it helped some
[doctor] okay that's good alright so we'll we'll do a physical exam on that elbow we'll take a look at it in a second but i do wan na talk to you about your your hypertension you came in today i know you have past medical history of hypertension came in today your blood pressure's a little bit high it was a one fifty over seven over ninety which is pretty high today i see you're on twenty of lisinopril have you been taking that daily
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so maybe you just have a little little white coat syndrome i know i have that myself and even though i'm a physician i i still do n't like to go to the doctor so i definitely understand how about your diet i know we talked a little bit about that before and you said kinda during the pandemic you fell off a little bit how you been doing that have you been lowering your salt intake
[patient] yeah but i only eat low salt items avoid adding salt to food kind of the whole whole family follows like a you know like a mediterranean diet
[doctor] okay
[patient] we try to be pretty good about it
[doctor] okay yeah that's good that that's that's definitely good yeah i know a lot of people during the pandemic it was you know sitting at home and and eating more than we should but that's i'm very happy that you've been compliant and you have that low salt diet so let's talk about your diabetes i think you see here on on five hundred of metformin are you taking that as well daily
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay and your blood sugars how have they been
[patient] since i do n't take insulin i do n't check it everyday when i have checked it it's usually running somewhere between eighty to a hundred
[doctor] okay yeah that's that's really good yeah so i that's that's pretty good so what we're gon na do we're gon na get a a1c just to see you know that range and it's possibility we can we can you know lower that metformin dosage but we will do that after your visit then we will take a look at that so lem me go ahead and will do that quick exam of your elbow but first i want to make sure you're not having any chest pain or anything like that
[patient] no
[doctor] no belly pain
[patient] no
[doctor] alright so listen to your lungs so your lungs are clear bilaterally listen to your heart so your heart exam you do still have that grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur but we know it about that before so let me take a look at your elbow so when i press right here on the back of your elbow is that painful
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright so when i have you you you flex and extend it it's painful does that does that hurt
[patient] yes it does
[doctor] alright so your right elbow exam shows you have pain to palpation of the olecranon area of the posterior elbow you do have mild pain with flexion and extension but you do have also normal range of motion at that elbow so we we did do an x-ray before you came in and luckily nothing's broken no fracture no bony abnormality so it's a normal x-ray which is really good so let me just talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you have a elbow contusion i believe your son did hit you with the lacrosse stick and it caused that that pain i see some swelling little inflammation there as well you have a little bit of a bruise i think that's that's what happened so for that i know you're having some pain i'm gon na prescribe you eight hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that twice a day and that should help with some of that swelling and pain i also want you to ice it three times a day for twenty minutes at a time that should also help with the swelling and pain and just for the time being for the next couple of weeks just you know maybe you know not play lacrosse with your son just to help that heal then you can get back on on the field so for your your high blood pressure we're just gon na keep you on the hypertension we'll just keep you on that twenty milligrams of lisinopril looks like you're doing great with that and your diet and then for your diabetes we will keep you on the five hundred milligrams of metformin and we will also get a a1c just to check your levels and see if we do need to adjust the medication in the future alright so do you have any questions for me
[patient] no sounds good
[doctor] alright so we will see you next time and my nurse will be in with those prescriptions
[patient] alright thank you","**SOAP Note**

"[doctor] tyler nelson , date of birth : 3 , 6 , 1949 , mrn , 385729 . he is here today for ongoing management of rheumatoid arthritis . last time he was here , he received a steroid injection in his right knee . hello mr. nelson , how are you ?
[patient] um , about the same as last time . my knee is still swollen .
[doctor] that was your right knee , correct ? i take it the injection did n't help ?
[patient] it did , maybe for a couple of weeks .
[doctor] that's it ? and is it still painful ?
[patient] yeah , it's pretty painful , and now the whole leg is getting swollen .
[doctor] okay , what would you say your pain level is ?
[patient] i mean , right now it's about a 3 or so , but , typically on a normal day it's around 6 .
[doctor] okay , and its been swollen like that for how long now ?
[patient] since i was last here a couple weeks after that . so about , maybe two months now .
[doctor] okay , but before it was just the knee ?
[patient] yeah , the whole thing was n't swollen like this , but i tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time , but it has n't been helping .
[doctor] okay , okay , so that has n't been working for you ?
[patient] i mean , it helps to some degree , but it's still swollen , especially around the knee .
[doctor] hmm . has it been keeping you from doing things during the day ?
[patient] well , i slowed down a little bit , and i found a few things too fast . but when it really hurts , is when i've been sitting for a while , and then i have to try and get up . i'm so stiff getting up i have to use a cane to get my bearings . i mean , after a little bit , it loosens up , but that first getting up is real difficult .
[doctor] yeah , i can see , that makes sense . have you been taking your medication regularly ? your on xeljanz right ?
[patient] yeah , the xr , i think its , uhm , 11 milligrams a day ? yeah , but i'm taking it everyday , and i'm also taking celebrex which i started maybe 2 months ago .
[doctor] yes , the 200mgs daily . how's that working for you ?
[patient] pretty good , up until it started swelling again .
[doctor] okay , well come sit over here , and if you could take of your socks and shoes , and we'll take a look at your knee . and just to let you know , i have a service now that writes my note about the visit , so you'll hear me call things out and describe what i see fully .
[patient] okay , gotcha .
[doctor] right , so let's check your leg . can you straighten it , and does it hurt ?
[patient] yeah , when i try to straighten it all the way it does .
[doctor] okay , range of motion slightly diminished . i'm going to press here , okay ? and how about here , hmm , i see some pitting around the knee and ankle . normal capillary refill in the toes . does any of this area hurt ?
[patient] um , just kinda sore , like an old bruise ?
[doctor] so , i can feel that the knee is hot , and that means there's something going on , like some inflammation . so we can give you another steroid injection for that . i also want to get an x-ray of that knee , so we can see where all the swelling is coming from .
[patient] yeah . let's do it . sounds go to me .
[doctor] okay , and did we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here ?
[patient] yeah , that was some years ago , but that was the other knee .
[doctor] okay . so i think we'll set that up for you now . we'll also do an x-ray on that knee . i can send you for a physical therapy , and if nothing is helping , then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee .
[patient] okay , sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right , so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot . i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection . there might be no fluid , but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless .
[patient] okay . and that's a procedure you're going to do right now ?
[doctor] yep . once we're done talking here , and as far as the edema in your legs , uh , we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause , but there is a lot you can do as well . the compression socks are a good start . um , and also , do you eat a lot of salt ?
[patient] i mean , um , i mean i love my salty snacks .
[doctor] okay . well , salt does have a tendency to make your body hold on to water , reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling . you can also prop your feet up any time you get a chance , especially at night . and have you talked to your private care doctor about this at all ?
[patient] no , i figured i would just come here first .
[doctor] okay . so i think , try some of those things out first , and if it does n't help , definitely make an appointment with them , also , as you know , xeljanz is a high-risk medication , so we need to check your cmp levels every couple of months . so this time your levels are good , but do make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time .
[patient] all right . i can do that . thank you so much doc .
[doctor] yes , of course . well let me go ahead and get supplies and we'll get to work on your knee .
[doctor] fluid aspiration and steroid injection procedure . the risks , benefits , and alternatives were explained . the risks of steroid injection were explained , including , but not limited to : hypopigmentation , soft tissue atrophy , tendon ruptures , and transient hypoglycemia among others . verbal consent was attained . the right knee was , uh , um , accessed through the lateral approach with 3 milliliters of initially clear fluid , then bloo- blood tinged fluid . then the right knee was prepped in a standard-fashion . the right knee was injected with 80 milligrams of triamcinolone , and one milliliter of lidocaine . the procedure was tolerated well , with no complications . post-procedure instructions were given . patient will follow up with his pcp . thank you .","**Clinical Note**

"[doctor] so hey christina good to see you today i see you're here you have a nonhealing foot ulcer well also looks like in my notes that you got some you've got type two diabetes and that probably the reason for your ear but ulcer not healing so how you doing today what's going on
[patient] doing pretty good except i ca n't get this ulcer to heal
[doctor] okay how long has that wound been present
[patient] maybe about a year
[doctor] a year well that that's a that's a a long time so when it started i guess did you have any trauma to the foot or did was it just all of a sudden
[patient] no trauma it just it seemed like a little blister and then i picked at it and it did get a little bit red and infected so i talked to my primary about it
[doctor] okay
[patient] i went on some antibiotics it seemed to get better but nothing is really making it go away
[doctor] okay when was the last time you were on antibiotics
[patient] it's probably been five months
[doctor] five months alright do you remember which antibiotics you were on
[patient] keflex
[doctor] keflex alright so kinda does your foot hurt or is it just just the
[patient] no pain but i do n't have much feeling in my foot
[doctor] alright so you've got neuropathy yeah that that that makes sense with the the diabetes so have you had any other symptoms like a fever chills any drainage coming from it
[patient] lately there has been a lot more drainage and i just feel a little more tired
[doctor] okay alright well that that sounds good so today is thursday so what do you have for the weekend
[patient] not too much i'll probably be walking around at the zoo on this ulcer all weekend and eating out and not doing anything my doctor wants me to do
[doctor] no yeah i yeah i know you do have that diabetes i know your pcp probably would n't be excited about you you eating out and all that but you know hopefully we can we i can at least get your your foot a little bit better so your diabetes i know we talked a little bit earlier how is that going for you is it controlled you know what's your your blood sugars running
[patient] yeah they are running better than they were but they are still in the two hundreds so my doctor does n't like that my last a1c was about ten
[doctor] okay alright yeah i i you probably definitely need to get back with your pcp about that because the a1c is is pretty high and i know he probably had you on some medication and insulin and metformin and insulin just to try to to get that lower but
[patient] yes
[doctor] you know we are here for your foot so let's let me take a look at that so we will do a quick exam of your foot so you do n't have any fever your vitals look good so on your your right foot exam i can see here you do have a one by two centimeter two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint i do see some yellow slough that's present with minimal granulation tissue you have no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there is n't any evidence of fluid collection i do n't see necrosis so there is no dead tissue around it there's no odor and i i do n't appreciate any bony exposure and does it hurt when i touch it here
[patient] no
[doctor] okay so we did a x-ray of your right foot before you came in and it showed no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that there is no bone infection which is really good so let me just talk a little about my assessment and plan of your your foot so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer so what i'm gon na do is i'm going to order a abi or ankle brachial index and that's just to determine your blood supply just to see if we can actually heal that wound i know it's been there for about a year which is a pretty long time and so we just need to see if we can if you do have that blood flow just in case we need to to make other goals for that foot just to depend upon that i'm also gon na do a debridement here have you had that done before of the
[patient] yes i think so
[doctor] okay so you know you know pretty much about that so i'm just gon na try to take off some of that dead tissue we'll do that here in the office afterwards and then i'm going to prescribe you some colaganase ointment and you could just add that to your wound once a day and cover it with a sterile dressing and we're gon na try to continue that until we see it start to shrink and hopefully you know that will work between the debridement and then the ointment did they give you at your pcp they give you a surgical shoe or have you been wearing your regular shoes
[patient] i've just been wearing my regular shoes
[doctor] okay so we're gon na get you a surgical shoe and i want you to to wear that and that can help you take pressure off the area because i know you said you're gon na walk around with this zoo this this weekend so i definitely do n't want you to put much pressure on it from now on and hopefully that can help it heal and so after all that i'm just gon na see you back in two weeks and we could take another look and possible do another debridement of the ulcer so do you have any questions for me
[patient] i do n't think so
[doctor] alright so i'll see you back in two weeks and i hope you have fun at the zoo this weekend
[patient] thank you
[doctor] alright thanks","**Clinical Note**

"Hello?
Hello?
Hello. Can you hear me?
Yes.
Great, excellent. Before I go any further, can I confirm you name and your, um, age please?
Uh yes. Um Laura Parkinson. And uh I'm forty five.
Forty five. Alright Laura, well how can I help you this afternoon?
Uh yeah. So I have uh soreness in my fingers, my finger, like, the skin on my hands is kind of cracked.
OK. When, when did this all start?
Um, a couple of months ago. I got it three, four months ago.
OK so it's been that long, has it? OK. And so you mentioned your , is it the skin on your hand, mainly that's dry?
Yeah.
Yeah, I haven't noticed. I mean, I have dryness, like you know, in other parts, like my legs. But it's not, it's not very, it's not severe. It's just you know, I've always, you know, I don't hydrate very much. So
Right. OK.

Yeah. Like it's very, it's very bad in my hands.
OK. Can I ask why have you come to see me today? Uh is it because it's got worse recently, your symptoms?
Yeah I mean, it's gotten to a point where, where it hurts a lot. And I can't really do my job. So, I thought I should probably get it checked out.
Yeah, that sounds like a very sensible plan. Um, which part of your hands are affected, mainly?
Uh the palm. I don't get, yeah.
Um, OK alright. Um, have you any itchiness in your palms?
Yeah, it's itchy. Not all the time, but yeah, it does get itchy.
OK. Any bleeding at all?
Um um I don't, I mean, no I don't think so.
you scratch yourself, you scratching yourself often, and bleeding?
Um, yeah I guess when I scratched it, yes it has bled sometimes but, yeah. Otherwise, it hasn't bled on its own.
OK. Um, fine. Uh
OK. Sorry, I'm writing notes as we go along. Um, and you mentioned that skin is quite cracked as well. Is that right?
Yes, that's right.
OK, alright. Um
, I know it's a long time ago, but do you remember how it all started? what were you doing at the time when it all started? Is it anything you may have done, to bring your symptoms on?
Uh, I mean I am a, I do work as a housekeeper. Um

And to be honest, I'm not always very good about wearing gloves. So that could be related. Um, I switched jobs, uh four months ago. Uh
OK. OK.
OK.
I've been working for, as a housekeeper for, for a while now, but um, that's the only thing I can think of.
Yeah, I think that might be quite important actually. I think there's definitely, maybe a correlation between the two.
Um, fine. And so you mentioned something about having general dryness. Is that, you mentioned in your legs as well?
Yeah. Yeah but isn't, sorry.
Is that, is that something you've, you've had for a while now?
Yeah. It's not really, it's not really major. Uh yeah it's just like literally grinding my legs.
OK.

Right, OK.
trouble.
OK. I'm just going to ask you some very brief yes or no questions, if that's OK. With your symptoms, have you, have you had any other symptoms, such as fever, or temperatures?
No.
Any nausea, or any vomiting?
No.
Any problem with your bowels?
No.
Any problem with your urine, or waterworks?

No.
Otherwise you feel well, do you? And yourself, your eating, drinking, your appetite is well-maintained?
Yeah.

OK, alright. Fine. Um, in terms of your past medical history, do you have any other conditions at all?
I have diabetes.
Do you know if that's type one or type two?
Type two.
Diabetes, OK. Anything else?
Um no.
Any skin problems?
No.
Eczema, dermatitis, for exmaple?
Not that I know of. No, I haven't been diagnosed.
No, OK. Which medications do you take?

Metformin, OK. Do you have any allergies, either to any medications or in general?
No.
OK. Family history-wise, is there anything I should be aware of?
Diabetes and what?
Diabetes as well. OK. Again, any skin problems?
Yeah.
Uh no, not that I know of.
Any history of asthma, or bowel problems?
Uh, no.
No. OK, alright. Um
Fine. In terms of social history, you mentioned that you work as a housekeeper. Um are you, you're not always very good at wearing gloves.
Yeah.
Um, you've recently changed jobs. Which which kind of places do you work in? Is it mainly residential, or is it commercial?
Yeah.
At a hotel. I have to do the whole thing like bedrooms, bathrooms, .
Hotel, OK.
OK. OK.

Do you think there might be a relationship between the two? Between the, kind of the products you're using, and your symptoms?
Yeah, I usually use those for bathrooms. But, yeah bedrooms and corridors not always.
OK. Have your symptoms stopped you from doing any work? Have you had to take time off work recently?
Uh, yeah like the past three days, I haven't been able to go to work.
OK. Can I ask a couple questions? Do you smoke at all?
No.
Do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
pints a week.
Once a week?
Uh, a couple of pints a week.
a week. OK so, very minimal, alcohol there. Um
have you tried anything for your symptoms? Have you tried anything over the counter? Any creams?
Yeah. I tried uh E forty five.
Any luck with that?

Yeah, no it didn't really do anything.
No, OK. Alright. Um
I also tried an antihistamine, antihistamine. Uh but it didn't
. OK, alright.
Um, Mrs. Parkinson, so I think um, based on your story, I I think you might have something called dermatitis or contact dermatitis. Which is very common in, particularly people in your in your in your field, who are using cleaning products, not using gloves. And sometimes you get a bit of reaction between the chemicals and your skin.
Um, so moving forward there's a couple of options. So firstly, what we try and do is, you know, avoid the triggers. In your case, I strongly recommend that you wear gloves when cleaning at all times.
Yeah.
OK. And in terms of helping your dryness and the cracking of your skin, um we can try some steroid creams to help with the inflammation.
Yeah.


As well as some stronger emollients, um which you really need to kind of coat on, three four times a day, for the next couple of weeks, just to help with the moisturizing of your skin.


Um if it still hasn't got better in about a week, two weeks time, I really need you to come back and see me again. And we can maybe think about other things we can give to you.

OK.
Is that all clear?
Uh yeah, that sounds good.
Great. Do you have any questions for me?
Um, where do I get the medicine from?
I'll I'll I'll do a prescription for you now, and send it over to your pharmacy.
OK great. Yeah, uh so you said a couple of weeks, it should get better, right?
OK.
I think I think minimum couple of weeks. Uh ten days to fourteen days. Um and if it still hasn't got better, or indeed if it's getting worse, like if it's spreading, or dryness is getting worse, come back and see me sooner.
OK.
Great. Thank you Laura. Thank you.
Alright. Thank you very much.
. Bye bye now.
Bye.","Laura Parkinson, 45, presented with a four-month history of hand dryness, cracking, and itching, exacerbated over the past three days to the point of interfering with her job as a housekeeper. She reported symptoms began after switching jobs to a hotel, where she frequently uses cleaning products without gloves. The palms of her hands are primarily affected, with dryness, cracking, and intermittent itching; occasional bleeding occurs from scratching. She noted similar dryness on her legs, though less severe, and attributes this to poor hydration.  

She has no history of fever, nausea, vomiting, bowel or urinary issues, or other systemic symptoms. Past medical history includes type 2 diabetes (treated with metformin), no known allergies, and a family history of diabetes. Social history reveals minimal alcohol consumption (a few pints weekly) and no smoking. She denied prior skin conditions, eczema, or dermatitis.  

Over-the-counter treatments (E45 cream, antihistamines) provided no relief. The provider diagnosed contact dermatitis secondary to exposure to cleaning products and inadequate glove use. Management includes:  
- Avoidance of triggers (cleaning products) and consistent glove use.  
- Prescription of steroid cream for inflammation and emollients (applied 3–4 times daily) to address dryness and cracking.  
- Follow-up in 1–2 weeks if symptoms persist or worsen, with possible escalation of treatment.  

Patient confirmed understanding of recommendations and was prescribed medications to be sent to her pharmacy. No further questions or concerns were reported.","Laura Parkinson, 45, housekeeper, presents with hand dryness, cracking, and itching for 3–4 months, worsening over the past few weeks.

[patient] i would like to definitely get the injection .
[doctor] okay . we can take care of that today while you're here and then schedule a follow up appointment in three months to see how you're doing , and then receive another injection if needed .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and here are the risks associated with getting the inje- injection . um , please just take a moment to review it and consent to the shot .
[patient] i'm good .
[doctor] great . we'll get that set up for ya . all right , well i hope things , um , feel better , and we will see you back here in three months .

"Hi.
Hi.
Hi. How are you?
Uh, , yeah. I'm all right, thanks. Um, though, I'm actually feeling a bit wheezy.
OK. My name is Doctor .
Like .
I'm one of that work for Babylon.
Can I confirm your name and date of birth, please?
Uh, yeah.
My, my name is, um, uh, Tina Smith.
And, I'm forty years old.
OK. And, are you in a space that's quiet and private?
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just, I'm .
OK. And, you mentioned that you are wheezy.
Mm-hmm.
Can you tell me a little bit more about that?
Yeah. So, um, it started, like, about two days ago.
Um, I don't know if it's because, you know, I was, like, cleaning the house. And, like, um, all this dust came out of the, the carpet. And, you know, I've always thought that maybe I've got, uh, an allergy to, like, dust. Um, I think so. So, if it was triggered by
Um, you know, two days later. Still not gonna be better. So.
Um, just getting a little bit worried about it now.
OK. So, you were cleaning the house two days ago. And, that's when it first started?
Uh, yeah. That's right.
Did the wheezing start suddenly, or was it gradual?
Uh, so, it started after maybe, uh, an hour or so .
And, has it got worse over the past two days?
Yeah. So, it get's a bit worse, um, at night, I find.
OK.
And, have you taken anything for the wheeze?
Uh, no. No, I haven't actually.
OK. And so, and the wheeze has been getting worse. And, today you're particularly worried. Is it because you're finding it hard to breathe or finding it hard to talk?
Yeah, yeah. A bit of both actually. So, um, I'm feeling like a little bit, uh, uh, short of breath.
OK.
Um, and, actually, when I'm, you know, talking, um, to my friends, I start finding that, uh, sometimes, um, I'm unable to , complete my sentences.
OK.
Um, it can, it can get really bad, yeah.
And, when you can breathe, and you take a deep breath, do you notice any pain?
Um.
Mmm, no, no. No pain.
OK. And, have you noticed yourself feeling dizzy or the rooms spinning more than normal?
Uh, no. No dizziness. Uh, none of that.
OK. And, have you been eating and drinking OK, particularly water?
Yeah, yeah. I think I'm having, like, you know, four or five glasses a day. Yeah.
OK. And, are you normally fit and well? Or do you have any other medical problems?
Um.
Well, actually, uh, I used to have, like, a bit of, um, asthma, uh, as a child.
Um, and, also in the summer I sometimes get, um, hay fever.
And, when you get hay fever, do you take any medications for it?
Uh.
Not really.
OK.
And, your asthma, did it resolve when you were a child?
Uh, I think mostly, yeah. I mean, sometimes when I, um, run for, like, long periods, it can, it can start up a bit. But, um, I have, uh, I have, like, an asthma inhaler. I use that.
OK. So, do you still have your inhalers?
Um, I think I might have one from, like, a couple of months ago.
OK.
Um.
But, you don't see your doctor regularly for asthma?
Uh, no, I don't.
OK.
And, apart from this, do you know if you're allergic to anything?
Uh, not that I know of.
OK. And, how far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment?
Sorry, could you repeat that?
How far are you away from a doctor's surgery at the moment?
Uh, they may be minutes' drive away.
OK, good.
So, given that you've had a history of asthma when you were a child,
And, you get hay fever sometimes in the summer.
Your shortness of breath.
Hi. I've lost, um, video signal. Can you still hear me?
Um, yeah. We just turned off.

So, given you've got a history of asthma and
hay fever. This could be one of two things.
But, we want to rule out asthma or an allergy first.
So, what you'll need is visit one of our clinics, so we can do some more tests.
OK.
Such as check your .
OK. Well what sort?
So, the first thing we would do, is use a small device on your finger, to check the amount of oxygen in your blood.
OK.
And, from that we can tell if it's asthma or something else.
Right, OK.
Before this happens, if you've got something, like an antihistamine, which you normally take for hay fever at home, I would take one, just in case it is an allergy you've had from the dust.
OK. Uh, yeah. I don't have any antihistamines at home, unfortunately.
You might be able to get one on your way to the doctor's surgery. If not, they can prescribe you one.
OK, OK. So, I can just get it over the counter then?
Yes. And it, they're normally about four to six pounds.
Great.
Is there anything else that you're particularly worried about, you want to ask me?
Um, um, not really. I mean.
I have, before, taken steroids for asthma. Um, I don't know if that's relevant.
Yes, that is. And, you may need to take some steroids now. But, we cannot, we, we won't be able to know until we've done those tests first.
OK, OK.
Cool. So, I'm gonna write a letter for your GP, just to let him know what's happened. And, the consultation with the GP in person shouldn't take too long.
All right. How long do you think it will take?
Probably ten minutes.
OK, that's great.
Cool. Um, you should get the letter over the app. And then, we can, you can take yourself to the GP.
All right. Thank you very much.
Cool.
OK, bye.
OK. Thank you. Bye bye.","**Clinical Note**

"[doctor] angela good to see you today so i'm writing here in my notes that you're you're coming in you had some left knee pain so how did you hurt your knee
[patient] yeah so i hurt my knee the other day when i was running around with my niece she she is learning how to take off the training wheels for her bike
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and i fell and i think i twisted my knee in some kind of funky way
[doctor] okay that that that that's not good how old are your niece
[patient] she is five and perfect
[doctor] well that's good that you're trying to help her with the learning how to ride a bike
[patient] yeah
[doctor] that sounds fun but i'm i'm sad as you hurt your knee doing it so for your knee pain are you are you able to bear weight on that leg the left leg
[patient] well i've been limping ever since and it really has n't gotten better so i thought it was maybe time to come see you because it happened about a week ago
[doctor] yeah yeah it's a definitely a good time to come see me so what part of your knee would you say it hurts
[patient] honestly it's been hurting on both sides more so on the inside than the the outside
[doctor] so okay so more in the medial aspect less on the lateral okay that makes sense and you said did you hear a pop when you when you twisted it
[patient] yeah i did
[doctor] okay alright so how would you rate your pain with your knee out of out of one to ten
[patient] it started off as like a four but i think it's getting worse and it's starting like it's it's like a like a throbbing kind of pain yeah
[doctor] alright and have you taken anything for the pain
[patient] yeah so i i had like a ulcer not too long ago so my doctor told me that i could n't take any like kind of advil or ibuprofen
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so i've been taking some tylenol and i wrapped it with kinesiology tape are you familiar with that
[doctor] yep yeah i'm i'm familiar
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright and has the has the ibuprofen been helping you at all
[patient] i ca n't take ibuprofen
[doctor] i mean i'm sorry the tylenol
[patient] no it's okay but the tylenol it helps like a little bit but you know like it's it's got like a time limit right so by the time and i'm not supposed to take it like more than like every like four hours or something like that but by hour or two like it it hurts again
[doctor] okay yeah that yeah you ca n't take too much of that tylenol because it'll it'll mess up your liver definitely
[patient] right
[doctor] alright so go ahead and do a quick exam on your knee here so when i press here does that hurt
[patient] yeah like when you press on the inside that hurts a lot
[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na do a couple of other other maneuvers here for your knee so on your left knee exam i do appreciate some edema you also have some effusion some fluid in the knee you have moderate range of motion so you're able to move it a little bit but not all the way i also see you have some pain on flexion and extension of the knee even negative lachman's test and a negative valgus and varus test as well so all that to say is i do n't think anything is is torn in your knee based on the your physical exam so we did do a x-ray of your left knee and luckily it was normal so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so everything is good there so let me talk to you little bit about my assessment and plan for your knee okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright so for your your left knee pain i believe you you have a mcl strain or a medial collateral ligament that's the inside of your knee i think when you were running with your knee she had somehow twisted it and so you strained that ligament there so for that what i want to do i'm going to give you some pain medication that's not an nsaid so i will put you on some tramadol you can take fifty milligrams you can do that twice a day and then you can take that tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain alright i'm gon na put you in a knee immobilizer leg knee immobilizer and you can wear that for the next week i just wan na keep the knee from moving so it can heal a little bit and reduce some of the inflammation that you're seeing here and i also want you to ice it and you can do that three or four times a day for twenty thirty minutes at a time and that should help some of that swelling as well and i i you know i know your niece is gon na be upset but i just do n't want you to be running probably for the next three weeks with her just to help us get time to let allow the knee to heal so how does that sound
[patient] that's alright how long do you think it'll be before i can like run or something like that
[doctor] hmmm i think you'll be back to normal in about a month the strain does n't seem too bad but we just need to get you off of the knee so we can allow it to heal i mean once we do that you know along with you know the icing the mobilization and you taking the medication i think you'll be good to go in a month if you do feel like you're getting a little bit worse please feel free to call the office and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an mri to you know to see if it's anything worse but i do n't think it is but just let us know how you feel in a couple of days
[patient] okay alright thanks
[doctor] alright any other questions
[patient] no that's it
[doctor] alright great thanks","**SBAR Handoff Format**  

**Situation**:  
Patient presents with left knee pain following a fall while assisting her niece with bike training. The knee was twisted, resulting in a popping sound, limping, and persistent medial-sided pain. Pain has not improved over the past week, with a current rating of 4-5/10, worsening with activity.  

**Background**:  
- **Mechanism of Injury**: Twisted knee during a fall while running with her niece (5 years old) learning to ride a bike.  
- **History**: No prior knee injuries. Patient has a history of ulcers, precluding NSAID use (e.g., ibuprofen).  
- **Medications**: Tylenol (acetaminophen) as needed, with kinesiology tape applied.  
- **Physical Exam**:  
  - **Edema/Effusion**: Moderate fluid accumulation in the left knee.  
  - **Range of Motion**: Moderate range of motion; pain with flexion/extension.  
  - **Special Tests**: Negative Lachman, valgus, and varus tests.  
- **Imaging**: Normal left knee X-ray; no fractures or bony abnormalities.  

**Assessment**:  
- **Diagnosis**: Medial collateral ligament (MCL) strain secondary to twisting injury.  
- **Rationale**:  
  - Medial-sided pain, effusion, and pain with motion consistent with MCL strain.  
  - Negative ligamentous tests and normal imaging rule out significant tears or fractures.  

**Recommendation**:  
- **Medication**:  
  - **Tramadol 50 mg BID** for pain management (non-NSAID).  
  - **Tylenol** as needed for breakthrough pain (avoid exceeding recommended dosage to prevent hepatic toxicity).  
- **Activity Modification**:  
  - **Knee Immobilizer**: Wear for 1 week to limit motion and reduce inflammation.  
  - **Rest**: Avoid running or strenuous activity for 3 weeks.  
- **Rehabilitation**:  
  - **Ice**: Apply 3–4 times daily for 20–30 minutes to reduce swelling.  
- **Follow-Up**:  
  - Re-evaluate in 3 weeks; if symptoms worsen or new concerns arise, consider MRI for further assessment.  
  - Return to normal activities by 4 weeks if adherence to plan is maintained.

"Hi there. Good morning.
Hello, good morning.
Um, I'm Doctor Deen Mirza from GP at Hand. Nice to see you.
Nice to see you.
OK. Before we start your appointment, could you please tell me your first name and your date of birth.
Yes. Uh, my name is John Smith. And I was born on the fifth of April, uh, nineteen seventy three.
OK, that's great. Thank you for that. Um, are you in a private place where you're OK to speak freely?
Yes. .
OK, OK, great. OK, so um, tell me a bit about what's been happening? You said you mentioned in the notes that you've got a problem with your elbow.
Yeah. Um, I just noticed this like about a week ago, or something? Um, have like a weird swelling on, on, on my elbow. I noticed that when I was in the shower. Uh,
It's not painful at all, or like, I I feel fine. But it's just, just a bit, a bit weird, to see that.
Um, it's, it's slightly warm. Um, and I, I, cannot feel like this, little bit fluid in inside, or, uh, um?
Sure.
Sure, sure. , and .
So, I, I like to know what's going on with .
, and so, did you say it was the left elbow or the right elbow?
Um, it's the, the left elbow.
Left elbow, OK. , and have you banged that elbow? Do you have any kind of injury?
No, not really. Um, not that I know of. I haven't noticed anything. I can actually like move it normally. Um, it's just, I , I can just see that. It feels a bit strange, a bit
Sure, OK. , and um, , in terms of your job, do you do anything physical?
Not really. No, I just, you know sit at a desk. Um, yeah.
Right. OK. , and um, has this happened before?
No, no I haven't noticed that before. Um, I don't have any like history of, of seeing this. I don't remember .
Sure, OK. Uh, and can I um, can I just double-check? Has anyone in your family, got any, kind of rheumatology, diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, or lupus or anything like that?
Um, no, well I, I do, well I think, I think I have something like uh, osteoarthritis. Um,
Uh, uh, it sometimes kind of hurts, uh, my joints. But uh, in my family, I'm not sure.
OK.
. No.
Sure. , so you know you said you think you've got , uh, osteoarthritis. Has anyone ever told you that? Have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that, and told you you've got osteoarthritis?
Um, yes. Yes, a few years ago.
OK. , was that a GP or a specialist or, was it, a physiotherapist?
a a GP. Um, yeah.
GP, OK, all right. Um, look can I just, uh, sorry can I just double-check how old you are please?
I'm uh, fifty three.
Fifty three, OK. Fantastic. All right. Um, and, do you have any other illnesses at all?
Um,
Well not, not really, no. Um, I'm, I'm allergic to, to peanuts. Um, but that's, that's pretty much all I uh, have to say about my medical history, yeah.
Right, OK. .
OK. Uh, are you, are, are you allergic to any medication?
Uh, no. Not that I know of.
No.
Sure. , and um, do you um, are you on any medication on a regular basis?
Uh, no.
No, OK. And are you normally fit and well? Mobile and active?
yeah. I do, I do, I do some sports. I run regularly, like two, three times a week. Um, yeah, no, I'm, think I'm healthy.
OK, good, good, glad to hear. Well done that's , it's good that you're doing that on a regular basis. OK. Um, and um, uh, can I, is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow, now?
Uh, yeah, sure.
OK, good, bear with me one second.
Right, OK. And if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that, a bit higher, so I can just see the underside. OK, fantastic, all right.
And then, just, bring it round to this side, , I can see other side. OK, fantastic. All right. And if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers.
There's, , is it, is it hot, compared to the surrounding skin, the adjacent skin?
Yeah.
It's a bit warm, yes.
It's a bit warmer. OK. Um, and um, is it very tender when you're pressing on that nerve? Is it, if you, if you give it a press, does it hurt you at all?
On the, on the tip of the elbow, it's, it's OK, just like, next to it like where the, the swelling is, it's a bit, yeah it feels weird.
OK. All right. Um, well, um, I noticed the skin was a bit dry, , on the tip of the elbow. Do you, do you have dry skin anywhere else on the body?
Uh, no not really. I have skin really dry now.
, do you , do you suffer from eczema at all?
No.
No. Alright.
OK. So um, what I think we should do, with regards to your elbow problem
OK. Is um, I think, it would be worthwhile. , this seems like uh, what we call the Bursitis. OK. So, that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint.
Um, what I think we should do is, I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication, in the, in the first instance.
OK.
And, as well as that, what I would like to do, is to get some blood tests done, to check for other types of uh, causes of joint swelling. K?
Alright.
So, um, what we're going to do is, we're going to arrange some, um, blood test forms to be sent out to your house. And, there'll be instructions within that pack, about where to go to get those blood tests done.
And, that will involve you, um, having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies.

So we'll do a full screen, and also check for things like Gout as well, OK. Um.
OK.
The time frame for that, will be um, the results will come back to us after about five or six days. Um.
K . O
From now, but it may take time for the form to come out to you. And if you get the form get the blood tests done straight away, by the time that we're expecting result back, you know one or two days after that, we're looking maybe six days.
And, what I would suggest, is, we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you, in one of our clinics, where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood test.
OK.
Uh, we can um, get a gauge as to, uh, what's going on. Now in terms of your joint right now,
It doesn't look like, to me that's something called, excuse me, septic arthritis. So, we're worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint.
Mm-hmm.
Um, and uh, your, your joint doesn't look like that.
Yeah.
However, if your, the elbow was to become very red, very painful, uh, and the redness was to spread or become uh, you know more intense. Then you need to get on the phone or get, have a video appointment , with one of us as soon as possible.
OK.
'Cause that would be an emergency. That would require more immediate assessment, more immediate treatment. OK?
do you, do you think it's something dangerous? Like something, like could I die from that, or is it, is it
No. I, I don't think this is anything dangerous. don't need to worry. OK? What I'm doing, is I'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to, to develop. K? So, , this, this is not the case right now. Right now, it looks quite straightforward.
OK.
Yeah, OK, I see.
It's nothing , sinister or life-threatening. Um, what I'm doing is I'm just saying, in case things worsen, these are the things that we'd be looking out for, and this is what we have to do. But you don't have that now, thankfully, and I don't think you're going to have it.
OK.
But I'm just saying, the what if scenario. Is that OK?
Yeah that, that sounds good. Thank you.
All right. Did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me?
Um, well just yeah I just wanted to know about this. Um, yeah it feels a bit better now . Uh, but yeah, no that's it. Thank you.
OK, all right. Um.
OK. So, I, I would take Ibuprofen regularly, OK. You can get that , over the counter. Um, that's four hundred milligrams, two times a day. And you should take, take that after food, not on an empty stomach. If you get any heartburn, stop taking it. OK.
OK.
Sure. thanks. Bye.
All right. So, what I wanna do is, I'll get the forms sent out to you.
And, um, we are going to arrange a, a follow-up appointment.
Maybe within a um, actually you know, the follow-up appointment doesn't have to be face-to-face, if it's more convenient for you do, to do it over the phone, we can do that over the phone, uh, over video. We can do that as well, that's, that's your call. But you contact us, , after you've had the blood test done, and we can review things then, OK.
OK.
OK, yeah that sounds good. I, I'll do that. And if I see that it's getting worse, I'll probably ask for a physical appointment.
Sure, sure that's a good idea. All right then, OK. Um, take care then. So , look just leave that with me, I'll sort all those bits and pieces out, and then we'll get them sent out to you, and then we'll, we'll um, review you after the tests, things goes well, OK.

Thank you. Alright. Sounds
All right then. Take care then, all the best. Bye bye.
Bye.","**Clinical Note**

[doctor] okay alright so when you dropped that brick on your foot were you able to get up and keep working or did you have to get off your you know not stop weightbearing and and get off that foot can you tell me a little bit about after the traumatic incident
[patient] i you know it was a little sore i called a few names you know god damn why is this in my foot but you know i kept working putting it around a little bit but now it's got swollen so i got to see my doctor he told me i had to go see you here i am so tell me what's going on with it
[doctor] so what have you been doing for the pain since the initial insult
[patient] lucken it up
[doctor] okay have you taken any medications safe for example tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain
[patient] no i feel like taking the medicine
[doctor] okay and then just out of curiosity you said you were doing some landscaping have you been over to landscapes warehouse new here in town my wife and i were just over there this last weekend and picked up a whole bunch of stuff you had a chance to make it over there yet
[patient] no not yet i heard about it though i might have to make a trip once my foot heals
[doctor] alright that sounds good now just out of curiosity can you rate your pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life
[patient] eleven out of ten
[doctor] okay and then have you experienced any numbness or tingling of that foot since the incident
[patient] yeah the whole foot is numb
[doctor] okay
[patient] but been now for a long time
[doctor] okay i'm gon na do a quick physical exam now your vitals look good and i would like to do a focused exam of your right foot the there is some bruising on the bottom part of your foot and on the top part as well and i do appreciate the associated swelling and i also recognize that you do have tenderness to palpation for midfoot now for your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is brisk in less than three seconds i do note a strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse with motor and sensation is intact for that foot i also like to call out the fact that it matches bilaterally which is important i'm gon na go ahead and review the diagnostic imaging results so we did a x-ray of that right foot and i do notice dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to your second metatarsal bone and the top of your foot this is where the metatarsals meet those cuboids okay so it where the bones come together in your foot now there are a lot of ligaments in your foot so i do want to order an mri just to assess if there is any injuries to those ligaments now based on your exam and looking at the x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery now the reason why this is important is if we have poor bone alignment or ligament healing you can this can lead to losing the arch in your foot you could becoming flat-footed and also developing arthritis now what's gon na be key here is the surgery is going to allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly we are going to put them back into place using plates and screws now the key thing is going to be it's going to be outpatient surgery so it's going to be same day i'll see you in the morning and then you'll be discharged home that evening and we will do a follow-up i wan na see you in twenty four hours post procedure but then i'll see you again in two weeks you're gon na be in a cast and i'm gon na have you use crutches you're not gon na be able to weight-bear on that foot for six to eight weeks what we'll do is we'll advance your ambulating gradually based on how you heal and based on how you tolerate the procedure i know i have covered a lot of material quickly but this is really gon na be the best course of action for you to have a good outcome now do you have any questions come answers concerns before i have the nurse come in finish the paperwork and get you set up for your procedure which we are going to do tomorrow if you're agreeable to that
[patient] what about putting in a cast can i just stay in the cast
[doctor] you could but what we found is the best outcome is aligning those bones with plates and screws to make sure that they heal properly so you have the best outcome possible
[patient] so if the surgery is going to be tomorrow when am i going to get my mri
[doctor] so what what we will do is the good news is we have an outpatient mri facility downstairs and i'm going to send the order down and we'll get you your mri this afternoon
[patient] can i think about it and we have some time
[doctor] sure
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright thanks elijah","**Clinical Note: ICF Rehabilitation Framework**

[patient] i'm doing okay . um , my osteoarthritis has been flaring up a little bit lately , um , so i wan na get- talk about that primarily . so , it's mostly in um , my elbows and it's really been bothering me . i've been sitting at the computer , at the desk more , um , in the office so i do n't know if it's being stagnant in that position all day has um , increased flare-ups for that , but i wanted to talk to you about that .
[doctor] okay , sure . and , are you right or left-handed ?
[patient] i'm right-handed .
[doctor] okay , and does one elbow bother you more than the other ?
[patient] my right elbow does bother me more than the other , but primarily , i'm typing all day versus writing , so it- it flares up in both .
[doctor] okay . all right , and um , any other joint pain ?
[patient] no , just- just really focused on my elbows .
[doctor] okay , and any numbing or tingling in your hands ?
[patient] uh , sometimes . when i'm typing for long periods of time , i feel a little bit of numbing , um , i try to shake out my arms a little bit . um , just to kind of relieve that um , sensation .
[doctor] okay . all right , and i know that you've had this also , had this history of gout . and the last episode you had was about three months ago . you had some inflammation of your toe . have you had any other issues with that ?
[patient] no , i have n't . um , the medication you gave me really controlled it , and i have n't seen a flare-up since .
[doctor] okay . all right , and how are you doing with your psoriasis ?
[patient] that's been under control too . that has n't been a- a major problem for me either .
[doctor] okay . i- i know that we had given you some clobetasol for your scalp . is that- so that's doing okay ?
[patient] yeah , that's doing a lot better .
[doctor] okay , great . um , all right , well , i'd like to go ahead and do a physical exam on you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] let's first look at your vital signs . hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . great , so everything looks good from that perspective . um , so looking at you , i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy . your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm , and your lungs sound really clear . on your right elbow , you do have some edema and inflammation of your right olecranon and there's some tenderness and an effusion right there . so um , does that hurt when i press it ?
[patient] yeah , that does hurt .
[doctor] okay , and when i turn your arm , do you have pain ?
[patient] yeah , that hurts a bit too .
[doctor] okay , so she has pain- to palpation of the olecranon bursa and pain with pronation and supination . and when you flex- and when you bend it and straighten it , does that hurt ?
[patient] yeah , it does and it's a bit stiff too .
[doctor] okay , so pain with flexion and extension of the right arm . uh , your abdomen is nice and soft , and there's no lower extremity edema . uh , let's go ahead and take a look at some of your labs . you know , you have a lot of arthritis for someone so young , so we had sent off that autoimmune panel . hey , dragon . show me the autoimmune labs . hey , dragon . show me the autoimmune profile . hey , dragon . show me the esr . okay , so that's good . hey , dragon . show me the uric acid . okay . all right , well , good . that's great . so , you know , it does n't look like you have any systemic arthritis , or sys- systemic inflammatory in process going on . so , my impression of you at this time is that from a gout standpoint , everything is nice and stable . i think that we should continue you on the colchicine 0.6 milligrams twice a day as needed for flare-ups of your gout . um , and then for your osteoarthritis , i'd like to go ahead and order a right elbow x-ray . hey , dragon . order a right elbow x-ray , and then i'd like to prescribe some meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day for the pain and the swelling .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon . order meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day . and then i'd like to um , just see those- how- the x-ray show- shows up and the results of that before we refer you for any type of physical therapy , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then from a psoriasis standpoint , i think everything is stable . we'll continue you on the steroid cream for your scalp , okay ?

"[doctor] hi virginia how're you today
[patient] i'm good thanks how are you
[doctor] good so you know you got that knee x-ray when you first came in but tell me a little bit about what happened
[patient] i was playing basketball and jerry ran into me and the inside of my knee hurts
[doctor] okay did you fall to the ground or did you just kinda plant and he pushed and you went one way and your knee did n't
[patient] i did fall to the ground
[doctor] you did fall to the ground okay and did you land on the kneecap i mean did it hurt a lot were you able to get up and continue on
[patient] i landed on my side i was not able to continue on
[doctor] okay so you get off the off the court is jerry a good player you just got ta ask that question
[patient] not really
[doctor] no
[patient] he does n't have much game
[doctor] okay okay well you know i love basketball i'm a little short for the game but i absolutely love to watch basketball so it's really cool that you're out there playing it so tell me about a little bit about where it hurts
[patient] on the inside
[doctor] on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything
[patient] i had ice and an ace wrap
[doctor] you had ice and what
[patient] an ace wrap
[doctor] and an ace wrap okay now how many days ago was this exactly
[patient] seven
[doctor] seven days ago okay yeah your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago so i'm gon na go ahead and now i also see that you're diabetic and that you take five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day are you still you're still on that medication is that correct
[patient] correct
[doctor] and do you check your blood sugars every morning at home
[patient] every morning
[doctor] okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control so you know may wan na continue to follow up with your pcp for that diabetes as we go through here and just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this
[patient] i did not no
[doctor] you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today
[patient] some exercises ice and mobic
[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal
[patient] yes it hurts
[doctor] okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me
[patient] when can i play basketball again
[doctor] yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball
[patient] i just played the wife with fun
[doctor] okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment

[patient] of anything the only thing i can think of is that i you know i am active and we've just been doing a lot of work in our basement so if i do n't know if i did something while doing that
[doctor] okay alright tell me have you ever had pain in that shoulder before
[patient] you know i i'm really active and so i i will get some aches and pains here and there but nothing that tylenol ca n't take care of
[doctor] okay good but now are you able to move your arm
[patient] you know i have trouble when i'm trying to reach for something or lift any objects and i do n't even try to reach it for anything over my head because then it'll really hurt
[doctor] okay alright and and now are you having the pain all the time or does it come and go
[patient] the pain is always there and then it gets worse like if i try to put any pressure on it it gets worse so if i'm laying at night if i try to even lay on that shoulder it's unbearable
[doctor] okay and then tell me what have you taken for your pain
[patient] i've been taking two extra strength tylenol every six to eight hours
[doctor] alright and and did that help
[patient] it does take the edge off but i still have some pain
[doctor] okay well i'm sorry to hear that you know you know renovating the basement it can be quite a task and it can take a toll on you
[patient] yeah i mean it's been fun but yeah i think it really did take a toll on me
[doctor] yeah what what are you doing with your basement are you are you doing like a a man cave or
[patient] yeah yeah that's exactly right
[doctor] that is awesome great well that sounds like fun i hope you get to set it up just the way you you would like for your man cave to be so congratulations to you there so tell me have you experienced any kind of numbness in your arms or in your hands
[patient] no no numbness or tingling
[doctor] okay alright so let's just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here i did review your vitals everything here looks good now lem me take a look at your shoulder alright now on your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion and how does that feel here
[patient] that hurts
[doctor] okay sorry there is tenderness of the greater tuberosity of the humerus but there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints you have good hand grips alright and then now on your neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is intact to light touch alright so what does that all mean well firstly lem me go ahead and take a look at your results of your shoulder x-ray here now i reviewed the results and there are no fractures so that's good so let's go ahead and talk about my assessment and plan here wayne so for your problem of left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured the tendons of the muscles that help make up your shoulder muscles so i will be ordering an mri for your left shoulder to be sure that there is nothing else going on with your shoulder okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] now i'm also going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and during that time you may also continue to take tylenol now if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection for your shoulder which can provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan at all
[patient] so do you think this pain will ever go away
[doctor] now well many patients are very successful with the physical therapy those will those help strengthen you know they do a lot of strengthening exercises with you to help strengthen you know your muscles so that it's not your movements not always relying on those joints predominantly so we're gon na go ahead and start with that and then see how you do okay
[patient] okay okay
[doctor] alright okay well do you have any other questions for me
[patient] no i think that's it
[doctor] okay well i'm gon na have the nurse check you out and she's also gon na give you some educational materials on the physical therapy and what to expect and and then go ahead and schedule a follow-up visit with me as well after you you do your physical therapy okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright well have a good day
[patient] okay you too
[doctor] thanks

"Hello.
Hi there. I'm Doctor Deen Mirza from Babylon. Good morning.
Good morning. Hi, .
Good morning. .
, sorry, , before we start. Could I get your full name and date of birth? Is that possible? Yes, it's, .
Yeah, sure. Um, my name is John Doe. Um, and I am twenty seven years old.
Um, so, I was born in nineteen ninety one, um, seventeenth of November.
That's perfect, thank you for that. Are you, um, John, are you in a private place where you're OK to speak at the moment?
Yeah, yeah.
, perfect, thank you for that. OK. So, tell me what the problem is. You've been having some difficulty breathing. Is that correct?
, yeah, exactly. I've, I'm , kind of struggling to breathe at the moment. I, I got stung by a wasp, um, recently.
Well, I'm not sure whether it's kind of bitten or stung.
Um, but I, uh, I'm feeling like slightly anxious that, uh, there's a bit of, I've got a bit of a, a rash on my arm where, i got stung.
Um, and, I've, kind of. But yeah, as I say, I've got this difficulty breathing and potentially, um, there's a bit of swelling in my lips. My tongue feels a bit weird.
Right, OK. So, when did this bee sting or bee bite occur?
Um, it was, just a few minutes ago.
Right, OK. Um, and, your, your lips don't seem swollen to me right now, but, do they, which. Can you show me with your finger where you feel it's swollen?
Yeah, it's just kind of on the right-hand side. Um, and it, and it's just a bit sore, maybe it hasn't kind of , fully swollen up yet.
Sure.
Sure, OK. Uh, you said you've been having some difficulty breathing.
Yeah.

Your breathing seems all right to me right now. Um, the reason why I'm, clarifying is, because we have to decide whether this is a, an acute emergency. Whether I need to send you in to hospital straight away.
Yeah.
Or whether we, more time to ask questions, OK. So um, , do you feel like you've got difficulty breathing right now, this minute, as we speak?
Right.
I, I, I , I don't, feel like it's , like particularly acute, but i'm just kind of a bit anxious that it might get a bit worse. I don't, I just wanted to speak to someone.
Sure, sure. .
Sure. No you, uh, you did the right thing and I, and I can understand it , it is quite anxiety provoking, OK. All right. Can I just double-check? Before we carry on asking other questions. Have you got history of anaphylaxis?
Uh, not that I know of.

No, OK. Have you ever been given an EpiPen?
Uh, I haven't no.
No, OK, all right.
Let, let's, um, take a step back now. So, in terms of the bee sting, it was a . Did you see a bee or you're, you're just , um, assuming it was a bee?
Um, I, , I, I find it difficult to tell the difference between a bee and a wasp, but um, , yeah it was one of the two.
. One of the two.
, OK. And, um, the area of your body that it stung. Where was it? Did you say it was your arm?
Yeah, it was on my arm.
All right. And you've got a rash there. Can I have a look?
Uh, yeah sure. Um, it's just, just there.
OK, all right. That looks OK to me right now. , does it look red to you at the moment?
Mm-hmm.
It's, it's slightly red, yeah and, and kind of there's, a bit of a, like a hole there, where I think that the wasp, stung me.


Yeah, yeah, yeah. The puncture mark, yeah, OK, all right. Um, now, is, is there any swelling, around that area, that you can see? I, I couldn't see any.
Uh, .
Not particularly. I, I guess it's just a bit kind of blotchy, uh, and a bit of a rash. It doesn't feel like, particularly swollen. Um.
Sure. OK, all right.Um, now, have you taken any medication? It's probably a , you probably haven't, 'cause it was a few minutes ago. But have you? Is . , not taken , any , antihistamines or anything like that?

Not at the, not at the moment, no. Nothing, nothing yet.

OK. , now, um, if I can just go back. Do you have any history of any , any, kind of illnesses at all?
Um, I've, I've had eczema before. Um.
OK, .
, that's kind of the, the major thing, nothing, nothing really.
, OK. Have you, got a history of any allergies to anything?
Uh, I'm allergic to penicillin.
All right, good. Um, and in your family, is there any history of any illnesses, or, any history of any kind of acute reactions?
Um, not that I think is, particularly relevant, no. I don't have, I don't have any.


Right. , and, um, do you have allergies to any kind of, cats, or dogs, or pets, or anything like that?
Uh, not that I know of, I've , yeah, I've been around dogs and cats, .

Yeah. , and you've got no food allergies as far as you're aware?
No.
OK.
Um, can I ask? Do you suffer from anxiety or panic attacks, or anything like that?
Uh, yeah, uh, sometimes, occasionally.
Right, OK. Have you ever been on medication for that?
Um, no.
OK.
No.
Um, great. Now, um, I need to ask a few questions, maybe not directly related to this, but just, it's for, for general information purposes.
So, um, , are you working at the moment?
Yes.
What do you work as?
Uh, I am a, uh, computer scientist.
OK. And, um, , you living alone?
Yes.
OK. Do you have any pets at home?
Um, I have a cat, at home.
A cat. OK, great.
What I'd like to do now. If that's OK John? Is, I'd like to have a look inside your mouth, OK.
Um, one of the things that, um, we'd be worried about if, someone's going to have an acute allergic reaction. Is to see whether there's any swelling, of the lips, or the tissues inside the mouth, or the.
Yep.
Yeah.
Soft tissues of the airway. And, um, I can, I've got a fairly good view of your lips, but I'd like maybe if you can, bring your device closer to your mouth, and then put your head back, mouth open wide. Sit somewhere where there's good lighting. And I just wanna have a look inside the throat, if that's OK?

Perfect, OK, great. Now, um, um, can, can I just get you to do it again? And, just say ah, this time.
Yup.
Ah.
OK, fantastic, brilliant. OK. Um.
Uh, John. Based on, um, how you look. How you're talking to me, and how you're breathing, and the appearance, and your wrist.
Um, I don't feel that you're having , a, an, an, a life-threatening, uh, allergic reaction.
Now it's very normal, to have, a rash, when you have some kind of insect bite. It's uh, it's a localised, um, uh, inflammatory reaction, that um, is normal and that , immediate reaction, that redness, and that maybe slight swelling, is usually temporary.
What we're worried about, is when someone has, um, compromise of their breathing. So you mentioned, breathing difficulties and you mentioned swelling of your lip. Thankfully I can't see any of that right now.
Right.
, but that's, the most, urgent and most pressing thing that we'd be watching out for.
Given that it hasn't happened, initially, it's unlikely to happen later. OK we, so we have like a , stage one and stage two reaction, for these types of bites.
And, usually if you're gonna have the reaction, it will happen straight away.
So, , we may be coming out of the danger zone now, it's um. But I'm just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are, in case it happens. So for example.
You would have, swelling of the lips, difficulty breathing. You might have something called stridor, which is an inspiratory sound that you, when you're trying, trying to breathe. It makes like a rasping sound, like this. OK. .
Thankfully, you don't have anything like that right now. It seems to me like this is a localised allergic reaction.
However, if anything changes, if anything deteriorates. Either make an appointment with us, or go straight to A and E.
Yeah.
Um, uh, and in some cases, if it's, if it's, uh, progressing rapidly, it's better to go straight to A and E, rather than to, wait for a booked appointment with us, OK.
What I'd like you to do now, is I'd like you to try and take some antihistamines.
So you can buy them over the counter. You can get Piriton or Chlorphenamine, and you can take one tablet, four milligrams, um, up to about six times a day. OK.
Yeah.
Or you can just take a one-a-day one, whichever is your preference, that's, that's absolutely fine, there's no, no issue. That should be enough to control this.
Um, if, the redness in your arm spreads, and you, it feels hot, or you, you know, you have signs of any localised infection.
We may need to think about other treatments, like an antibiotic.
And like I said if anything deteriorates, in terms of your breathing, that's urgent and we need to process that, , action needs to be taken urgently.
Yeah.
Did you have any other, um, queries or was there anything else that you're worried about?
OK.
Uh, no, I think, I think that kind of, that makes me feel a bit better. I guess, can I get that um, can I get the, uh, so the antihistamine from any shop, or like does it pharmacy?
Yeah, that's, that's over the, yeah , over the counter. You don't need to, any chemist, will have it, you don't need a prescription for that. Yeah, it's probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually, than to get it via prescription.

OK. Um, now, um, uh, on the basis of what you've told me, I don't think you need any allergy testing. I think this is just a , a straightforward localised reaction to a, an insect bite.
OK.
However, if it was to happen that, you know, this, you're, you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other, , non-specific rashes. We might need to think about blood testing, I don't think we're at, at that moment yet. OK.
So uh, but , that's something to bear in mind in case this, becomes a recurrent pattern.
OK.
OK.
OK then, so, we'll leave it like that for now, OK. I'm gonna leave a link to some information about anaphylactic reactions, just for you to read about it. I don't want you to panic, but just for you to be aware what symptoms are.
Great.
Yeah.
If those kind of things happen, get back to us.
If you're feeling worried, just have a lower threshold for , having a chat with us, sometimes a chat is all you need to calm things down.
OK, great. Yeah, that makes sense.
All right then John, OK. Uh, well we'll leave it like that, , come back to us if you have any further issues.

OK. Thanks. I appreciate your time.
My pleasure. All right, take care then. All the best.
Bye bye, bye.
Bye bye.","**Clinical Note**

No pain, OK, OK. Have you noticed yourself, any, any, any temperatures or fevers? Um, feeling hot and cold? Sweaty?
Yeah, yeah that's, that's, that's, that's definitely something I've noticed. Like, you know in, in bed with the wife and having to, you know get out and, get the blanket off, and put it back on again it's, it's not, it's not pleasant. I mean, I'm keeping her up at night as well, which is a, bloody nightmare but, I mean, you know how these things are.
.
.
Yeah, .
Seems, seems very difficult at the moment. Um, , have you measured your temperature at all? Have you, got a ?

But uh, no I mean, no you know, you know, I can, I just feel it in my forehead but, I mean, I haven't, haven't, you know, used a thermometer or anything.
Mmm, OK.
Sure, OK. Um, and just moving on, just very quickly. Um, any other symptoms? Any nausea? Any vomiting? Any tummy pain?
Uh, the, the first, the first day I had, you know a wee bit, of uh, , you know uh, you know the rot like, a wee bit of diarrhoea.

OK. And how's your appetite? Are you eating and drinking OK?
Uh, yeah I mean I'm, I'm, I'm trying to and I think what, what is you , you starve, a cold and you, feed the. I, can't remember what it is, but I think I've, uh, my appetite's been, been all right yeah, yeah. I'm trying to, trying to keep, keep the fluids up as well you know, I hear that's what you should do.
.
Yeah, absolutely, , completely uh, recommend that, so keep, keep doing what you're doing. Um, and just lastly, you know any, any, any kind of muscle pain, joint pains?

Yeah.
Yeah it's, it's, it's just been a wee. I mean again, you know I'm , I'm getting a just a wee bit older now so it, it's, it's not something that I, I was thinking about but, I have, I have noticed like when I, you know, when I'm bending down and.
Know moving about, it's just, a wee, a wee bit stiffer than, than normal. , you know and I'm, I think that might be to do with whatever this.
Mmm.
Thing is, but, again it's, you know, I'm just getting on.
And where do you, where do you feel the stiffness?
It it's, just kinda, like you know when you're, when you're bending like, elbows and knees and just, just a wee bit, kinda stiff, you know?
, all over, OK. And just remind me sir, when did your symptoms all start? , you say a few days ago?
Yeah.
Yeah I would say what day is it today? It's uh, , Wednesday, so it would have been, what is it Saturday, 'cause I was out.
It's Wednesday.
OK.
Yeah I was out having dinner, and then, yeah I, I came, yeah, yeah, yeah it would have been that. 'Cause I was out, for my wife's, uh she's, she was, doing this wee thing, we had a wee bit of a celebration, so we were out for that.
.
And I remember saying to her, it was like you know what? I'm, I'm, I'm not feeling, great. You know I , I stuck it out with her but, aye, it would have been that, Saturday. So, what's that about five, five days ago? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Four, five days ago, yeah. OK. Are you aware of anything that might have set your symptoms off/
No I haven't been, haven't been , I mean, as I said, I was out with my wife. I don't know whether it's like, you know, the restaurant we went to was like, it was like, pretty good, so I wouldn't have expected them to be serving me anything.
Dodgy or anything like that but, I , I, I, I don't know, you know. So, , nothing that I can see.
, OK.
And , without prying too much, what were you celebrating?
Well, my wife, has just been, uh, promoted. So, she's now going to be, uh, a head teacher, of, of primary school. So, just took her out.
.
.
. Yeah, wee, a wee night on the tiles, for that, so uh, it was good, . Yeah, yeah.
, very nice.
, good, excellent. So just moving on sir. Uh, regarding your, um, what we say, past medical history. Are you, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of? So anything to do with your heart, lungs?
Uh, I mean, I'm a , I'm a wee bit, on the chunky side.
You know, uh, you know I've, I've got a wee bit, a wee bit round the midriff, the spare tyre's, definitely there. Uh, and I've, I've got the uh, I've got the diabetes.
Diabetes, right. What type of , is it type one or type two?
Uh, it's, it's uh, type, two, two. Aye, type one, , aye, aye. 'Cause he said, the doctor I spoke to, he was sort of saying like, you know, as a bigger guy, it's, it's kinda, it's kinda like, yeah, and.
OK, OK.
And what.
.
Yeah, OK. .
And uh, aye, when I was speaking to uh, it was this, it was other, another doctor I spoke to a while ago but. Aye when he, took the, when he was telling me this as well he, took my blood pressure and that said that was, that was high, uh, high, higher than it should be.
.
.
You've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, uh, or . OK, all right. So um, moving on. Come to your medications, , which medications do you take on a regular basis?
. Yeah, yeah.
Uh, give me, I'm just gonna check. It's, it's, let me know if I'm pronouncing this correctly 'cause I haven't got, I haven't got my glasses with me. So, it's , Metformin?
, that's correct, OK.
and, and there's another one, , Lisinopril? Is that? Yeah, . I mean that's those two, I had, I've got them written down a wee bit of paper so.
OK. Lisinopril, yeah. That sounds like.
No problems, no problem, that's fine. Anything else sir?
Uh, no, no, just, just, just those two. Yeah, I mean a wee bit of like , a wee bit of Aspirin or whatever every now and again, but you know nothing long-term.
Right.
OK, all right. And just moving on swiftly sir. Do you have any allergies at all?

Uh, not that I'm, not that I'm aware of. You know, I mean, what, what are the, what are the allergies you get? Just, you know, nah, not.
Just allergies to , medications really, I'm, I'm asking not, as opposed to um, other things.
Right ah, yeah. No, nothing, nothing that, nothing that I'm aware of, doctor's never said nothing to me, so.
.
OK. And just very briefly, socially sir, just it's very important to ask. Uh, you said you live, with your wife. Anyone else at home with you?
Uh, no, no, kids, the kids have uh, they've flown the nest. So uh, now it's just me and the missus, you know, good life.
OK.
OK, OK. And are you, yep, and are you working at the moment? Uh, yourself?
Uh, I am. Yep, yeah, yeah um, .
What, what do you do at work?
Uh, well I'm, it's one of the, there's a wee factory, just uh, down the road, um, so we just you know, we just manufacture like uh.
Uh, it's like, kind of steel, steel parts, uh, things like that. You know, so it's a, good wee job, you know, keeps us, a roof over the, over us.


. Pays the bills, really. Um.
Yeah, yeah, aye, exact, exactly.
What, what about smoking and alcohol, sir?
Do you, you do either?
Uh.
I, I do, I do like a wee drink.
Uh, aye the doc, the old, doctor I had, he, he, he did say I was drinking just a wee, a wee bit too much. I mean I'm not like, you know I'm not, not an alky or anything, but just, just uh, yeah, do like a few, a few pints every now and again.
roughly on average, how many you would drink a week?
Uh, pints?
Well, whatever you drink. Is it , beer, lager, wine, spirits?
. You know, maybe, maybe what like four, four pints on like Saturday and then, you know on, Sunday as well, , maybe like.
Nine, nine pints in a week, I would say.
OK, OK. And what about smoking, sir?
Uh, ugh, , a wee, every now and again, but I'm, I, I am trying to cut that down. I've got a wee uh, what are those wee things called? The wee vaporisers.
Ohh OK, OK.
Yeah I've got, I got, I got myself one of those, so I've been, I've been cutting down on the cigarettes. Uh, and I just got this wee, this wee thing, it's great, it is, it's actually like amazing, by the way.
Well, I wish you , all the best on your journey to quit, I , I highly recommend it. Um, if you can, it'll certainly help your health as well. Um, so just to , just to summarise, I think you know, uh, based on your story.
Thank you.
Um, yeah I'm not, worry. I think you know what you essentially have is a bit of a, a bit of a viral illness perhaps, a bit of a, maybe early signs of a flu, um.
Mm-hmm.
Which I think should, settle down, um, really on it's own, uh, over time. Um, things to you know, you, you can do, help yourself you know, , stay rested, drink plenty of fluids.
Right.
Yes, aye.
Um, if you are, if you are feeling hot and cold and sweaty, taking regular Paracetamol would be beneficial. Um, you mentioned feeling a bit short of breath. Um, I'm a little bit on the edge about giving you antibiotics. I don't think you've got a chest infection, but what we could think about is giving you a.
Aye.
A script for antibiotics, which maybe use in next, twenty four to forty eight hours, if your symptoms don't get better.
Right, so , so if, so if I'm, I just , just lie down and take it easy. If I'm still, feeling a bit rubbish then, I go in, I .
Yeah.
Yeah, , I will, yeah, I'll, I'll give you a script today, give it about twenty four to forty eight hours. If you feel like you're still feeling breathless and, run-down, I think there's no harm in starting a course of antibiotics, something like Amoxicillin.
One tablet, three times a day. Um, uh, and , if you're still not better by next week, come back and see me, we can have another look.

All right, OK. OK, so I just, plenty of rest, lots of water, hopefully this thing pass.
Exactly.
Yes, absolutely.
Right, that is, that's perfect, that's just what, , what I wanted to hear.
Great, well, I'm, glad I could help.
And um, I wish you and your football team all the best.
Cheers.
Aye, I hope so, I hope so. It's not, not looking too good, but uh, aye. Right, cheers, cheers, .
OK. , all the best. Bye bye.","**Clinical Note**

"Hi there. I'm Doctor Smith from Babylon.
Hi.
Hi there. Can you just confirm your name, date of birth, and the first line of your address, first of all please?
Yeah. Uh, my name is Valerie Cole. My date of birth is the nineteenth of September, nineteen ninety three.
My name's .
My address is, uh, sixty four, Cliveden Place, in, South Wimbledon.
OK. Are you in a private place where you can have a confidential consultation today?
Yes I am, yeah.
What can I do for you?
Um, I've been feeling really anxious over the past few months. Um, I just get really nervous every morning about leaving the house, and it's started to really worry me, and just add up, and build up on that anxiety. And I just didn't know, who to talk to or, so I wanted to check with my GP.
OK. Do you mind just telling me a bit more about, when it started? Do you think there's something which changed in your life at that time?
Um, I guess so, I think um, I would say maybe about two months or so, I've been feeling like this, and that probably coincides with, me starting a new job, um.
Which I , I would say it's quite , I mean every job is stressful, and when you first start, but it's been really stressful I think over the past two months, definitely.
What's your job?
Um, so I work for a, a, a fashion retailer, in um, the head office team, and it's just a brand new sector. I've never worked in retail before, my boss is not very nice to me and I don't.
But I also think that, it's just been, I just really dread, going there. I just hate, speaking to her, I hate like seeing everyone and, really worried about whether I'm doing well or not.
And it's really impacting on like, on the rest of my life, like my sleep and stuff like that.
OK. So, um, just day-to-day, tell me, from the start of your day, how it affects you. You said that you, you dread going to work.
How, how does it affect you, in terms of like your sleep at night, and things like that?
Right.
Yeah, this is really so, I, I, I've, as I say like, I don't want to go to work in the morning, so I just find no way of, I can't get out of bed.
But it's also because, when I leave I just, when I've left work, I just feel so stressed and so worried about everything I've done, I can't get to sleep for hours and hours and hours. So I.
OK. So what time, what time do you go to bed at night-time?
About ten, eleven, probably.
And what time do you get to sleep?
Not for ages, I'm, I'm lying awake all night
OK. And, when you eventually get to sleep, do you wake up with your alarm in the morning, or does something else wake you up, before then?
Mmm.
So I find my, my heart kind of racing, and then I'm just like panicking that I'm gonna be late, and that that's gonna make work even more stressful. So I do have an alarm, but I find myself waking up before that, 'cause I'm just my heart is racing. And actually the other day, I was just like, I was lying in bed and I really thought my heart was racing so much, I thought I was gonna have a heart attack in the morning.
OK. And, so how many hours sleep do you think you get a night?
, I just, I can't even tell because I feel like I'm, even when I'm in sleep it's such a shallow sleep, but maybe, three, four hours, I'm getting now.
OK. And, what about your eating patterns, any change in how you're eating, or whether you, your appetite's changed?
Probably, not, significant changes maybe. No I wouldn't say that, I wouldn't say that I'm eating like, much differently. Ohh that, I probably have more chocolate than normal, just because I feel, so down.
OK. You're eating regularly otherwise?
Yeah, .
OK. And, you told me about the palpitations, just tell me a bit more about that.
Yeah, So um, it's, it's usually kind of like, when I realise in the morning that, either um, I feel like I'm gonna be late, because I've like overslept 'cause I'm so tired.
Um, or I wake up in a panic thinking I am gonna be late so, it's just kind of like, just a constant like, rapid heart beating. It's just really, really stressful. I don't know if it's, stress or if, , or I did think it was like, a heart problem really actually.

Does it feel like a regular fast beat, or an irregular, beat?
Irregular, I think.
And how long do you think it lasts for when you get it?
Ohh it can be anything, I think couple of minutes, or the other day I was actually just, sort of lying there for like, holding my hand on my chest for like ten minutes.
OK. Is that something that you've had before this, or is that a new thing?
Yeah, but I would say this is only in the past. Sort of like, couple of months as I say that I've been, experiencing this.
OK. Any chest pain with that?
No, um, well yeah it's painful to , when the heart, when my heart is beating fast but, but, yeah.
OK.
And, in the daytime, how, how, you said you, you're not getting much sleep so, how's your energy level in the daytime?
It's just, really, really low, I mean I, I'm finding now that I'm just, I find no enjoyment at all.
It's kind of day-to-day, and anything that I'm doing. It's not just my job it's, you know when I leave I'm just so tired that, anything that, previously was, really fun is just not, it's not enjoyable. And I'm like, yeah, on edge the whole time.
OK. So what do you do in the evenings?
Well right now I'm, I'm working so late, and everything is really, really stressful. So I don't really get much time to myself but, when I do wanna go out, or, you know, see friends or just relax. It, it seems quite difficult to do that.
OK, and , are you avoiding contact with friends, or do you still see them?
I avoid them insomuch that I, feel like I'm.
Yeah, so I mean sometimes it just, I know that I'm not gonna have fun, because I don't want to, go out and, do things that I would normally have done.
OK. What about, hobbies, or exercise, or anything else outside work? Do you do anything else outside work?
Yeah, as I say like everything that I had previously been doing has been, just difficult to continue with like, I did used to like to like go running, and.
And to play tennis and stuff, but now it's just not, I'm just not enjoying it, I'm not, I'm not like, I'm not going out to do that quite so much.
And have you, has it ever got so bad that you've actually had to miss work?
No, 'cause I think that would just add to the tension, but I do like pretty much every morning I think, ohh I should call in sick or like, just not go.
OK.
And, what's the worst that it's got? Have you ever, been, um, so overwhelmed that you couldn't, get in to the office, you couldn't, go into a situation?
Have you ever had a panic attack?
, um.
No I wouldn't say so, I think, I've always managed to make it to work.
But I, I wonder if it's building up. So this is why I wanted to call, I'm just worried it's building up to that, and I don't know what to do 'cause I have, feel it, felt it, get worse and worse over the past couple of months.
OK. And apart from work, are there any other situations which evoke quite extreme anxiety, like being, in public places, social situations, public transport, anything like that?
Yeah I mean, I find public transport really stressful anyway, especially being on the tube it's, 'cause it's quite, getting warmer so it's just really airless.
Um, but I think the majority of it, 'cause my life is just so focused around work right now, the majority of it is focused around work as well.
OK. Before this did you have any similar times in your life when you felt like this?
Not really I, I'm, no, I would say. I mean everybody always has a bit of tension, a bit of anxiety but, I've never felt, anything this bad before.
OK. And what about your mood day-to-day? I mean, I can see that you're quite distressed by like that. Do you ever get really down about this?
Yeah.
Um, I mean, yeah, yeah, 'cause I do, yeah. I'm pretty much, down like, I don't enjoy, being and not just my day at all 'cause.
I'm just so worried about everything, um, and I find that even when I'm not, like even at the weekends and stuff it's just the, kind of like constant, feeling of just being a bit, down, a bit unhappy.
When do you think you last felt yourself?
Um.
I don't know, that's a good question, I can't really, I can't really put a on that at all.
. And has your mood ever been so low that you've felt like you just couldn't carry on with your job, or with your life, or with your normal, uh, things as they we're going on?
I wouldn't, no I wouldn't say that I've had, I haven't had any suicidal thoughts or any, thoughts that have been that extreme like, I haven't.
You know I have, I have a good support system, like I do have good family and stuff. So I, I have, I don't have, uh worries about, actually wanting to, um, not go on. It's just that, I don't wanna go on like this.
Yeah. OK. And where do you, who do you live with at home?
Sorry?
Who do you live with at home?
Yeah, I live with my parents, just my parents.
Um, and, how much alcohol do you have in an average week do you think?
Um, ooh I don't know, probably quite a lot on the Friday or Saturday, just because, that, that's kind of normal, um.
Uh, maybe I, maybe I do have like a bit during the week. Like, my parents obviously are retired, so they just drink whenever they want, so, whenever they're having a glass of wine, they'll offer it to me and it's like. I guess I don't really keep track of it that much.
OK. So, how much would you, would you guess?
Probably like, probably quite a lot on a Friday or Saturday, because it's usually going out, so maybe like.
I probably go over my limit just on those days, anyway, and then like, maybe a glass of wine during the week .
OK. Do you smoke or take any other drugs, or anything?
Um, I try not to smoke, but I do, occasionally, but I don't take drugs.
OK. And have you done , anything yourself to help? Have you , have you talked to anyone, talked to any counsellors? Done any, online, looked online at all? Any ways to ?
I, well I talk to my mum, because she also suffers from, well she's , suffered from like depression in the past. I didn't think that it was, that I was suffering from, actual depression because it just seems to be, manifesting as, as total , as just stress the whole time.
OK.
But um, I did talk to my mum about it but I haven't sought any, she recommended that I come to the GP, um, but I haven't sought any other.
OK.
And would you be happy to, have, some one-to-one therapy?

Yeah I think, yeah I think so. I've never done that before, but yeah.
OK. I mean what we would suggest in the first instance is to, to. So you can self-refer via the NHS, for what we call like, talking therapy which is a type of inter-behavioural, where they can really look at your situation. How you're reacting to, the, , why, what's provoking anxiety, and what you can do, to try and overcome that.
OK.
Yeah.
Um, so I can send you the link for that.
Um, in the meantimes it can be a bit of a wait. There are some online resources that are really helpful. Um, can put the details, on there and you can, get on with them straight away and try and work through them as well.
Uh-huh.
Um, and if you're feeling like it's not helping at all, or your anxiety is getting worse, to the point where you can't cope with work, or you can't, just do your normal things day-to-day. Then, it's important for us to, for you to give us a call, back and just discuss that, further.
OK. .
I mean some people, with anxiety they, do need to take medication to control that but that's, not something that we'd suggest in the first instance.
OK.
And I'll put some more information on your notes about, helping with your, sleep patterns and things like that.
That's great, I look forward to reading it.
Um, in terms of palpitations, it is most likely to be a, , associated with anxiety, but it's probably worth having couple of basic blood tests just to make sure that, there's not something triggering that off. And then arranging a GP follow-up a week after you've had the tests, so we can just go through the results with you.

OK, OK. Yeah, .
So if you call the support line you can arrange the, to have the blood test done.
OK, I'll call them up.
OK?
Thank you so much.
All right. Take care.
Have a good day. Bye.

"Hi there, it's Doctor Smith from Babylon.
Hello.
Hi there.
Hi, can you confirm your name, date of birth and your home address, please?
Yeah, it's Matt Carter, and it's fourteenth of August, nineteen eighty nine, and what was the last bit?

Your address.
And it's one Babylon Avenue.
And are you in a private place where you can have a consultation today? What can I do for you?
Yes.
Um, coming, I, I don't really know what's been going on, but it's just aching all over, but, definitely the last six weeks, it might have been slightly longer than that, but it's just sort of that, feeling really tired, run down.
OK, um, so when do you think you were last well?
Uh, where are we now, we've just started April. I, definitely Christmas, New Year, I felt relatively well, I think.
Um, so, since then. Actually, yeah, I, I was on holiday in, um, in the States. And yeah, it probably coincided with some time around then. End of January, start of Feb.
So do you think it started when you were on holiday or after you got back?
Uh, probably a couple of weeks after I got back.
Were you well when you were on holiday?
Yeah, had a had a great time, very active, uh.
Did you get any infections, chest infections, diarrhoea, vomiting, anything like that?
Um, no, not that I recall. Um, yeah, not.
No, the symptoms sort of all started afterwards.
OK. So, just tell me what symptoms you've been having, in terms of just your general health. Any persistent cold symptoms or earaches, sore throat, chest cough, shortness of breath, phlegm, anything like that?
Uh, no.
Any change in your weight at all?
Uh, I don't think so. Like, I'm probably less hungry, but no, no weight change, just a bit.

No.
Any change in your bowel habit, diarrhoea, vomiting or blood in the stool?
Uh, no.
Any difficulty passing urine or blood in the urine?

Or.
Um, I don't have any rashes now, but there was, uh, in fact I've got a photo, um, on my phone if if that's helpful. I can try and show you, hang on. Um, because this, yeah, this was weird, this sort of came up, and then, uh.
OK.
OK.
Disappeared after a couple of weeks, where's the light, that, you see that?
OK, right, yeah, whereabouts was it?
Uh, I think sort of calf, back of my calf, because I didn't notice it, my wife noticed it actually.
When did you first notice it?
Um, probably, uh, around the end of February, the middle to end of Feb. And then it, like, it didn't actually cause too much itching, or anything, at the time. And, I, it faded over a couple of weeks, I guess.
Did you have any fevers at that time?
Um, I, to be honest that actually turns out it was a bit of a sore throat I had, um, so possibly a little bit feverish, but I, I sort of put it down to that.
Do you know where you got that, when it started? Had you been walking, did you get any bites that you noticed?
Uh, I like, I do quite a lot of walking, and we did, um, quite a lot while we were out in the, on holiday as well, but definitely, um.
Yeah, I mean, I don't, I don't recall any bugs, I don't remember seeing anything bitten but you often, like, yeah, as you're walking through, I was in shorts and, and boots but /
OK.
Whereabouts were you in the States?
Um, just sort of, um, he examined me, so.
OK, and any headaches, blurred vision, tingling, numbness?
Um, no.
But it's the sort of headache maybe in just generally feeling a bit crappy.

And have you been able to go to work as usual?
Um, I've been going to work. I don't know how effective it's been. But, yeah, been, been.
And what's your job?
Um, I work for a health technology company actually.
OK, and has your concentration been affected, or your tiredness levels in the daytime at work?
Yeah, definitely sort of tired and, um, yeah, less energy, sort of probably than I, I would normally be.

Have you been able to exercise OK?
Um.
Not as much. I, I don't know if it's, I haven't been able to or I've just been a bit lazy with it. I I'm not exercising as I would normally.
OK, fine, and, um, how's your mental health, your stress levels, all that?
Hey.
Pretty good at the moment, actually. Like, it previously that has been an issue, but, um.
Other than, sort of, physically feeling a bit.
Uh, crappy, I've.
Yeah, in a pretty good place.
OK. Apart from that rash, any other rashes on your skin, or swelling of your joints, or pain in your joints?
Uh, yeah, sort of aching shoulders, back, the hips, knees, but sort of, yeah. Not ,
Any swelling that you've noticed?
No, .
Your hands, wrists, ankles, toes.
Uh, no.
OK, um, and any other significant medical problems in the past?
Uh, I mean.

Pardon?
Asthma and hay fever if they can help.
OK. Any flare-ups of your asthma recently?
Uh, no, pretty well , I think.
Do you take your regular inhalers or other medication?
Uh, yeah. I've got one of those, um, preventative, I think. Yeah , but I've not used one.
You haven't been using it, you said?
I, I have it. I've been using the everyday for the morning and night but not the, uh, .
OK.
And any, erm, do you take any other medications?
Um, I take, um, one of the antihistamines it might be can I get that from, just from the pharmacy.
Yeah, that's fine. Um, and do you smoke?
uh, .
Drink any alcohol?
No.
Sorry, occasionally, that was.
OK, and who do you live with at home?
Uh, just my wife.
Um.
Sorry, um, so with this rash, we would need to investigate whether this has been a contributing factor to your symptoms. And just because of your symptoms, which have been ongoing for six weeks, that's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels.
Um, I think it's important to get some blood tests, checking all the normal things, like liver, kidneys, blood count, etc. But also, some more specific things like, um, a bacterial infection you can sometimes get, uh, including one which you can get which can produce a rash like that. So, that would involve blood tests. Are you happy to do that?

Uh, yeah, I but, uh, what, what's the infection?
Well, you can get, uh, you can get a bacterial infection caused which is called, um, it's called lyme disease that you can get a rash like that from a tick bite.
So that's something we would do a test for, as well. Um, and if that comes back positive, then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it.
OK.
OK.
So it's definitely worth checking for, but we would also check just for which can cause reduced energy, tiredness and aching for, persistent over six weeks.
OK.
So if you're happy to do that, if you book that through the support line, and then when you've had the test arrange a follow up about a week after, after you've had the test done.
OK, so, do the test first and then, and that follow up we can just do over the phone again? Or, yeah.
Um, yeah, we can do that over the phone to start with.
All right. Excellent.
OK?
That, that's really helpful, thank you very much.

Oops, sorry, you broke up a bit there.
Any other questions?
Ohh, no, not , no.
OK, that's great. Take care.
OK, take care, thank you, bye.
Sorry","**Discharge Summary**  

**Patient Information**  
Name: Matt Carter  
Date of Birth: August 14, 1989  
Address: 1 Babylon Avenue  

**Hospital Course**  
The patient presented with a six-week history of generalized body aches, fatigue, and reduced energy levels, with symptoms worsening since returning from a holiday in the United States (end of January to start of February 2024). He reported no significant symptoms during the holiday but noted a gradual onset of fatigue and malaise post-return.  

Key symptoms include:  
- **Generalized myalgias** (shoulders, back, hips, knees) and **fatigue** persisting for six weeks.  
- **Transient rash** on the posterior calf, noted by his wife in late February 2024, which resolved within two weeks. No associated itching or fever, though he acknowledged a mild sore throat with possible low-grade fever.  
- **Reduced appetite** and **decreased exercise tolerance**, with no significant weight change.  
- **No gastrointestinal, urinary, or neurological symptoms** (e.g., diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headaches, or tingling).  
- **History of asthma** and **hay fever**; no recent exacerbations.  
- **Current medications**: Antihistamines (self-administered), preventative inhaler (not used recently).  
- **Lifestyle**: Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use. Lives with his wife.  

**Discharge Diagnosis**  
- **Possible Lyme disease** (considered due to history of tick exposure during travel, transient rash, and persistent fatigue/myalgias).  
- **Chronic fatigue syndrome** or **systemic inflammatory condition** (to be evaluated further).  
- **Rule out infectious etiologies** (e.g., bacterial infections) and **hematologic/liver/kidney dysfunction**.  

**Disposition Plan**  
1. **Laboratory Investigations**:  
   - Complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), liver function tests (LFTs), and renal function tests.  
   - **Lyme disease serology** (IgM/IgG) to evaluate for potential tick-borne infection.  
   - **Infectious workup** (e.g., EBV, CMV, hepatitis panel, HIV).  

2. **Follow-Up**:  
   - Schedule a follow-up consultation **one week after test results** are available.  
   - If Lyme disease is confirmed, initiate **antibiotic therapy** (e.g., doxycycline) per guidelines.  
   - Monitor for improvement in fatigue, myalgias, and energy levels.  

3. **Patient Education**:  
   - Advise on **symptom tracking** (e.g., fatigue, joint aches).  
   - Encourage **continued use of asthma inhalers** and **avoidance of alcohol**.  
   - Reassure that the rash was likely unrelated to Lyme disease, but further evaluation is warranted.  

4. **Return to Work**:  
   - Patient is advised to **maintain current work duties** with accommodations for fatigue, if needed.  
   - If symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop, prompt medical evaluation is recommended.  

**Next Steps**  
- Patient to book blood tests via the support line and follow up as directed.  
- Discharge instructions provided, with emphasis on adherence to testing and follow-up.

"Hello, hi, I'm Doctor Jacob and welcome to Babylon.
Hi.
Hi. So, just before we start is it alright if you could confirm your name for me please?
Yep, uh, John Doe.
OK and your date of birth?
Uhh, twenty-one twelve and nineteen uh eighty-six.
And, your address for me, please?
Is, uh, number one London Street. Um, NW three six PQ.

That's correct. And just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation?
We are, yes.
OK. So I understand you're having a a headache is that correct?
Uh yeah, iIve had a, um a sort of a, a, a very sort of bad, severe headache, the past four days. Um, and um I've been sort of feeling a bit hot as well. Um, I've got, got a bit of a temperature, I think.

I haven't measured it but um, think I've, yeah, I think I've got a fever.
OK. Right. And um, so what started first, was it the headache or the fever?
Um, so um, headache started uh, first. Um, and then sort of yeah, fever sort of came along a bit afterwards.
OK, afterwards, right. And what have you taken so far for your headache?
Um, so I've had some Paracetamol and some Ibuprofen, but it's not really helping at the moment.
OK. so just a few more questions, with regards to your headache So do you find it difficult to look at the light?
Yep.
Um no, like um it, it's fine, light doesn't seem to bother me too much.
OK. Uh, and is it any pain when you try to move your neck from side to side, look up and down, is there any pain?
And I've got some general aching muscles. Um, not necessarily sort of in my neck. It's kind of a bit all over, really.
OK, all over. Right, and have you been sick with this headache?
No, no I haven't, I haven't been sick.
OK, and do you have a cough?
Uh no, no cough.
OK, so there's no cough or cold, yeah?
Uh, no. No.
OK, and you your ears are OK? There's no earaches?
Um, no it's, it seems to be OK. It, it's fine.
OK, all right. And with this headache have you experienced any pins and needles in your face, arms and legs?
Uh, no.
No pins and needles. Any muscle weaknesses at all?
Um just, I, I suppose general aching, body aching.
Not, not any weakness but where you couldn't, you know, hold a cup or anything like that, that's what I mean.
Uh, no. I'm, I'm sort of, yeah, seem to be sort of fine with that sort of stuff but, yeah.
Ohh
Okay, and um just a few more questions to you, because I don't have any of your background history. Um, do you suffer from any medical conditions?
Uh no, um general medical history is fine.
Fine. And no surgical history then and no medical surgical complaints, yeah?
Uh, no. Um, I, I suppose uh I have been away to um, uh, Thailand. Um, uh week or so ago. Um

had some, like, usual mosquito bites from sort of traveling around and a friend of mine has also been a bit unwell, but um, uh, yeah, that 's the only sort of, like, history per se.
Right, and um, do you have any kind of shivering at all? Do you shivering with the fever?
Um, I um, uh, I I do feel cold quite a lot. Uh, you know it's, um, I no sort of shivering, but definitely like a bit cold.
cold, yeah? OK, right. And are you using you mentioned about the paracetamol and now, but are you on any regular, any medication, anything that you're using at all?
Yep.
Uh, no.
OK. Um, any allergies at all?
Uh, no. Um
Alright.
OK and... OK, so uh I, I believe that it is quite important for us to actually examine you, yeah?
Um, it it's not possible for us to do that online. I think you would need to come into one of our hubs to have a proper examination, and I, I think you would need one quite urgently, OK? So the thing that's running in the back of my mind are um, kind of a viral illnesses that can one can get with um, sort of mosquito bites or foreign travel.
OK.
Like , um the other common thing around Thailand, it will be like some dengue. But that would have, like you would have some, uh, blood spots or bleeding or something, which you don't have at the moment, do you?
OK.
Uh no. I mean I've got a bit of a rash, but nothing like, uh no, no, no, no bleeding.
OK. So where is the rash?
Um, it's uh, the rash is kind of all over my body. Like it's not, it's not, it's not really localised.
How would you describe, how would you describe the rash?
Um uh sort of red and itchy.
Red and itchy. OK. So if you were to put a glass on top of the rash, does that rash go away?
Yeah.
Uh, yes.
It goes away. OK.
OK. So what we need to do, need to urgently examine you. And that's sometime today. OK? And um, after our examination there is a high possibility that sometimes we might need to send you to hospital. But I'm not sure as yet. So I'd like you to be seen in one of our hubs as soon as possible?
OK.
OK.
So um, I'll recommend that you would need to be urgently seen by the doctor, preferably in the next few hours time. OK? And um, in any case if that's not available I'd like you to take yourself to . Alright? Any questions at all?
OK.
OK.
Uh, no. Sounds serious.
, you know obviously when I've spoken to you, you, you didn't tick the box for many theories, but you're in the middle somewhere. Let's put it that way.
OK.
Um you know things like we have to rule out is Meningitis and all, but Ben, you just have a general muscle ache. You didn't say that you had things like, you had problems looking at the light or something Those are things when you think of Meningitis
But and then, it's the uh, in meningitis you get a non-blanching rash. While in any kind of virus the rash usually goes away. Saying that, we don't know whether these are the beginning stage. So that's why I'd rather, but I would rather you see a GP as soon as possible, if uh, we've got a slot available. But if not, I think you need to be seen, and maybe have some blood tests and examinations. OK?
OK, cool. Thank you very much.
All right, you take care, Ben. Bye now. Cheers. Bye.

Uh, just Paracetamol. Um, I'm allergic to Aspirin, so I haven't been taking that.
What happens when you get a, when you take Aspirin?
Um, I just feel really sick.
OK. And have you ever, taken any, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, like Ibuprofen, Naproxen, anything like that?
Um, I have in the past, I haven't been taking it, last few days.
OK. Um, so, this headache is new to you, and you've, you've not had regular headaches before?
Yeah.
What I would, suggest is, taking, uh, um, some anti-inflammatories, along with the Paracetamol.
OK.
Um, as a. Uh, you said you're eating OK?
Yeah, yeah, fine.
I mean it, from the sounds of it, it does, sound quite like a migraine, but obviously if you had no history of that, in the past.
Um, and is anything changed recently, or any, anything you've done recently might've, triggered it?
Uh, not that I can think of, um, may have been a bit stressed out at work, that kind of thing, but .

Yeah. Um, well that would be the first thing to do, is to take some anti-inflammatories along with the Paracetamol. Make sure you're really well hydrated.
Um, and, see how that goes, and if it, if it isn't settling, or it's getting worse, or you get any other change in your headache. Um, or you're unwell with it, with a high temperature, then we would certainly need to speak to you.
Straight away about that. The other thing is if you, if you're getting persistent, um, headaches, or headaches associated with your menstrual cycle, or certain things seem to trigger these headaches.
Then, it, it would be worth, having a further discussion about it, to see whether we can, work out if we can help the, that longer-term.
OK, brilliant, thank you.
Um, I would, try and arrange to get your blood pressure checked, if you haven't had it checked for a while.
Uh, and, thing to do is to have a thermometer at home, so you can make sure that your temperature's OK.
OK, sure.
Yep.
If you have a raised temperature or, your headache's just getting worse, or you develop any rashes or anything like that. Then we'd need to speak to you straight away.
Yep, OK, that's brilliant. OK, so I'll take some Ibuprofen and I'll um, hopefully, be a bit better in a day or two then, so yeah.
OK, so, have you got any other questions?
Uh, no, that was it today.
OK. OK then, we'll, we'll, we'll, um, speak to you again.
OK, brilliant. Thanks so much.
, very much. Bye.

"Hello?
Hello?
Hello? I can hear you, can you hear me? . Excellent, just before I go any further, can you confirm your name and your age, please?
Hi. Can you hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you now.
Uh, yeah. My name is Jessica Smith, and I'm nineteen years old.
OK. And how can I help you Mrs Smith?
Um, yeah so uh, I mean this is, this is a bit embarrassing, but it's, it's uh, hurting when I, , when I use the bathroom, when I pee. And um, it's been going on for a few days, so I'm a, I'm a little bit worried about it. Uh, not sure what to do.
Right, well , I, thank you for coming in, so hopefully we can help with your symptoms. Um, so you mentioned it started a few days ago. Um, so, can you tell me a bit more about that, what kind of pain it is, that you're experiencing?
Um, it's, it's not too bad, it's sort of like a stinging kind of pain. Um.
It's not like unbearable, but uh, it's , it's definitely uh, it definitely bothers me when I pee. Um.
And uh, yeah I also maybe sometimes get some like, pain kind of lower down in my tummy, when I, when I go to the bathroom. Uh, yeah.

, OK. And, and, uh, the pain in your tummy, is it, can you describe the , the pain to me? Is it cramping, burning, sharp?
, yeah, I don't know maybe uh, sort of, sort of cramping. I'm not really sure, but it's not like, it's not like cramping like when I get, when I have a period or something. It's like, I don't know, .
Right, right, OK, OK. Um, fine. And, have you found yourself going to the toilet more often than normal?
Um, not, I don't think so, I haven't noticed that.
No, OK, fine. Have you noticed any, any funny colour to your urine? So, has there been, uh, , any blood in your urine? Have you noticed any other darkening of urine?
Um, there was a little bit of blood earlier today, um, but besides that, not at all, no. Um.
It does kind of, it, it kind of like, doesn't smell very, it smells a bit weird I guess, um, but, no, not really anything uh, anything drastic.
Yes.

OK, fine, OK. Um, right, let me just , write a few notes down as well. Um.
, and you mentioned a tummy pain, that also started a few days ago. Does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards the back, or towards your flank, the sides?
No, not really, no.
No, OK, fine. With those symptoms, have you noticed any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting?
Uh, no, not , not at all.
OK. Any fevers, or temperatures?
think so.

No, no, no fever, no.
No fever, OK, fine, sorry. Um, OK. Um, in terms of your bowel, are your bowels working OK?
Um, uh, I think so, yeah, it seems .
So, uh, by that I mean, um, any, any diarrhoea, loose stool?
Uh, no, not that I've, not that I've noticed at all.
OK, all right. And um, Jessica, sometimes we have to ask very private sensitive questions, uh, just to , get a full history. Um, hope you don't mind me asking, but are you currently sexually active?

Uh, yeah I am.
OK, is that with a regular, partner?
Ohh, yeah, so I, I've had a boyfriend for about a, a couple of months now, yeah.
Fine, OK. Um, have you noticed any other discharge from, from down below?
I haven't noticed anything.
No, OK. When was your last um, uh, last STD screen? If, if ever?

Don't think I've ever, I don't think I've ever had one.

Do you use any form of contraception, at all?
Uh, yeah, we use condoms.
You use condoms, OK. And when was your last, period?
Uh, couple of weeks ago.
Three weeks ago, OK. Is there any chance you could be pregnant perhaps?
Say again.
Is there any chance you could be pregnant?
Uh, I don't think so, I don't.
No, no. , it's always worth asking uh, young females like yourself, um. Uh, um, so if that obviously you are worried about the pain.
Yeah.
Um, not getting any better, uh, then I'd always , advise getting a pregnancy test, to rule out pregnancy. OK? Um, fine. So just moving on, moving on. Are you otherwise fit and well?
Uh-huh.
Um, yeah, I think I'm, I'm feeling OK, otherwise, yeah.
And so by that I mean, do you have any other medical problems, medical , medical history?
Um, so, in the past I've had some uh, some IBS. Um.
But, other than that I think no like uh, real serious medical problems that seem, yeah.
OK. Do you take any regular medications?
Uh, no, I did uh, I did uh, a little bit ago, or a couple of days ago, try some uh, over the counter bicarbonate, to try and help with the pain but it wasn't, it wasn't really helping.
OK. So you've tried that and it didn't help? OK, all right. Um, do you have any allergies to any medications?
Uh, yeah, I'm allergic to, Clindamycin.
And what happens when you take Clindamycin?
Um, I, I get some like a, a, a swelling, basically.
Right then, OK. So it's quite a, seems like a quite severe allergy to it, is , is that right? Um, OK. Fine. In terms of your family history, is there anything I should be aware of, um, related to kidneys, bladder, bowels, guts?
Yeah.
Uh, no I don't think so, not that I, not anything I know about.
OK, all right. And tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's lives, who's at home with you?
Um, so I live in a, live in a flat near my college, with a, a couple of like friends of mine. Uh, so I'm, I'm not like living at home or anything. Um.
OK, and what .
about sorry.
OK, and are you a, are you working at the moment, or are you a student?
I'm a student.
OK, and what are you studying?
Uh, I'm studying biology.
And how's that going?
Um, it's good yeah, it's really, it's really interesting uh, learning about, learning about how uh, how the world works, yeah.
great. Do you have any aspirations for the future, in terms of careers?
Uh, I don't know, maybe a doctor someday, you never know.
, recommend it, we need doctors. Um, what about smoking and alcohol? Do you drink much in the way of, , do you, do you smoke, or do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
Uh, I don't, I don't smoke, uh, I do drink, like on the weekends, yeah.
, so socially, OK. All right. Um, right, excellent. So, um, at this stage I , I would proceed to examination.
Yeah.
But um, based on your story, um, just to summarise really. So, last three days, you've been having bit of burning pain on passing urine. A bit of, crampy tummy pain lower down.
Um, , essentially but, but no other fevers or back pain, uh, if I, if I understand correctly.

I think probably do have what we call a simple UTI or urinary tract infection, bladder infection, um, which can be readily treated. So, I'll give you a course of antibiotics today.
Mm-hmm.
OK.
Something, called either Nitrofurantoin, or Trimethoprim. Uh, and it's normally a three day course. Uh, so, one tablet, twice a day, for three days.
OK.
And , that should hopefully help your symptoms, but I also advise you to drink plenty of fluids. Let's try and flush that, you know, that infection out of your body, if you can.
OK.
Um, you can try, cranberry juice, that can sometimes help with your symptoms.
Um, and if you're still not better, by the end of this week, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me. And uh, we can have another look at your symptoms.

OK, so three days of the medication, and then wait a little bit, if it still doesn't go away, call back, that OK?
OK.
Yeah, yeah absolutely. And things to look out for would be, you know, if you are having kind of, high temperatures, a back pain, um just , generally feeling more unwell.
Uh, you know, I do want you give me a call back, 'cause then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys, which is something we wanna avoid. So, do, do give me a call if you're having any concerns, OK.
OK.
OK, is there, is there anything like, like, should I be worried about? Like, like, not having sex or anything within the next week, or anything like this?
Yeah I mean if you can try and avoid it, I think that'd be sensible. Um, uh, it's great that you're using barrier contraception. I would recommend you to continue using barrier contraception, but if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up. That'd probably be the best for you and your boyfriend,.
OK, OK. Uh, that, that makes sense. Ohh, OK, thank you so much.
All right.
Great.
Thank you very much. Wish you all the best.
Yeah, thank you. Take care.","**SBAR Handoff Note**

"[doctor] hi russell how are you what's been going on

[doctor] i saw my doctor and they ordered a cat scan and said i had a kidney stone and sent me to see a urologist okay well does the pain move or or or go anywhere or does it stay right in that same spot yeah it feels like it goes to my lower abdomen in into my groin okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go it comes and goes when it comes it's it's pretty it's pretty bad i feel like i ca n't find a comfortable position okay and do you notice any any pain when you urinate or when you pee
[patient] yeah it kinda burns a little bit
[doctor] okay do you notice any blood i do n't think there is any you know frank blood but the urine looks a little dark sometimes okay and what have you taken for the pain i have taken some tylenol but it has n't really helped okay and do you have any nausea vomiting any fever chills i feel nauseated but i'm not vomiting okay is anyone in your in your family had kidney stones yes my father had them and have you had kidney stones before yeah so i i've i've had them but i've been able to pass them but this is taking a lot longer okay well i'm just gon na go ahead and do a physical examination i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm going to explain what what those mean when i'm done okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so on physical examination of the abdomen on a abdominal exam there is no tenderness to palpation there is no evidence of any rebound or guarding there is no peritoneal signs there is positive cva tenderness on the right flank so essentially what that means russell is that you know you have some tenderness over your over your right kidney and that just means that you might have some inflammation there so i i reviewed the results of the ct scan of your abdomen that the primary care doctor ordered and it does show a . five centimeter kidney stone located in the proximal right ureter so this the ureter is the duct in which urine passes between the kidney and the bladder there's no evidence of what we call hydronephrosis this means you know swelling of the kidney which is good means that things are still able to get through so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and my plan okay so for your first problem of this acute nephrolithiasis or kidney stone i i wan na go ahead and recommend that you push fluids to help facilitate urination and peeing to help pass the stone i'm going to prescribe oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours as needed for pain you can continue to alternate that with some tylenol i'm going to give you a strainer that you can use to strain your urine so that we can see it see the stone when it passes and we can send it for some some tests if that happens i'm also gon na order what we call a basic metabolic panel a urinalysis and a urine culture now i wan na see you again in one to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we'll have to discuss further treatment such as lithotripsy which is essentially a shock wave procedure in which we sedate you and use shock waves to break up the stone to help it pass we could also do what we call a ureteroscopy which is a small telescope small camera used to go up to to the urethra and bladder and up into the ureter to retrieve the stone so let's see how you do over the next week and i want you to contact me if you're having worsening symptoms okay okay sounds good thank you","**Clinical Note**

"[doctor] alright you can go ahead
[patient] hey alan i good to see you today so i looked here my appointment notes and i see that you're coming in you had some shoulder pain left shoulder pain for the last three weeks so
[doctor] how you doing is it is it gotten any better
[patient] yeah yeah i've been having a lot of pain of my shoulder for the last three weeks now and it's not getting better okay do you remember what you were doing when the pain first started
[doctor] so i i was thinking that i i ca n't recall like falling on it injuring it getting hit
[patient] hmmm
[doctor] i have been doing a lot of work in my basement and i even i put in a new ceiling so i do n't know if it's from all that activity doing that but otherwise that's that's all i can think of
[patient] okay so do you remember hitting it or anything like that
[doctor] no nothing at all
[patient] okay alright did you fall do you remember doing that
[doctor] no
[patient] okay hmmm so like a little mystery so have you had pain in that shoulder before
[doctor] i mean i'm very active so i can get pains in my shoulders but it's nothing that sometime some tylenol can help
[patient] okay and are you able to move the arm or is it kinda just stuck
[doctor] i'm having a lot of pain like i can move it but you know when i try to reach for something lifting anything and even like i do n't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain
[patient] alright so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder
[doctor] it actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder it does n't go down anywhere
[patient] okay and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go
[doctor] it's pretty much all the time anytime i put any pressure on it like when i'm trying to sleep it hurts even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well
[patient] okay so i know you mentioned tylenol so this time i have n't taken anything for it
[doctor] yeah i i do the tylenol which usually works for me and it does take the edge off but i still have pain okay did you try icing it at all
[patient] i iced it initially but i have n't iced it at all recently
[doctor] alright
[patient] and so with your shoulder have you experienced any numbness in your arm or in your fingers
[doctor] no numbness or tingling
[patient] okay good so i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam and take a look at your your shoulder so i reviewed your your vitals everything looks good with that so touch here in your shoulder so your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion so pressure here so that there is tenderness of the greater
[doctor] okay
[patient] tuberosity of the humerus let's see there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro
[doctor] yeah
[patient] acromioclavicular joints
[doctor] yeah yeah
[patient] and looks like you have good hand grip let me see so on the neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is is intact to light touch
[doctor] yes thank you yep
[patient] so you did get a we get we had to get a x-ray of your shoulder before you came in and so it's normal so that's really good so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you you do have that left shoulder pain so your symptoms are
[doctor] most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured tendon you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na order an mri of your left shoulder
[patient] and so we're gon na begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on have you done physical therapy before
[doctor] i have n't
[patient] okay so what i'm gon na do i'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder and that should definitely help with the pain during that time you can also continue to take tylenol i do n't think i need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you so if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which should provide some relief but i think right now we can just go with the the pt and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury so do you have any questions about the plan
[doctor] so like i said i'm really active do you think that this pain will ever go away
[patient] yeah so many patients are very successful with rehab and so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time once we build up those muscles around that shoulder you know things things the pain alleviates itself and and and you will be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights all all the active things people do these days
[doctor] okay alright thank you
[patient] bye
[doctor] okay bye","**Clinical Note: ICF Rehabilitation Framework**  

**Body Functions**  
- **Musculoskeletal System and Muscular Function**:  
  - Left shoulder pain of 3 weeks’ duration, persistent and constant, with increased severity during activity (e.g., lifting, reaching overhead).  
  - Limited active and passive range of motion; tenderness at the greater tuberosity of the humerus.  
  - No tenderness at sternoclavicular or acromioclavicular joints.  
  - Normal hand grip strength and neurovascular exam (capillary refill <3 seconds, intact light touch sensation).  
  - No numbness, tingling, or radiating pain.  
  - X-ray of left shoulder shows no fractures or bony abnormalities.  

**Activities**  
- **Upper Limb Functions**:  
  - Impaired ability to perform overhead movements, lifting, or reaching due to pain.  
  - Pain interferes with sleep and daily activities (e.g., inability to raise hands overhead).  
  - Reduced capacity for sustained physical activity (e.g., basement work, weightlifting).  

**Participation**  
- **Work and Leisure**:  
  - Occupational activities (basement construction, physical labor) contribute to symptom exacerbation.  
  - Participation in recreational activities (e.g., running, jogging, weightlifting) is limited due to pain.  
  - Social and recreational engagement may be affected by sleep disturbances and functional limitations.  

**Assessment and Plan**  
- **Diagnosis**: Likely rotator cuff tendinopathy.  
- **Interventions**:  
  - MRI of left shoulder to confirm diagnosis and assess soft tissue integrity.  
  - Referral to physical therapy for 6–8 weeks of strengthening and rehabilitation.  
  - Continue Tylenol for pain management; consider steroid injection if symptoms persist.  
- **Prognosis**: Expected improvement with rehabilitation; gradual return to activity as musculature strengthens.

"[doctor] alright teresa i see here in your chart that you seem to be experiencing some elbow pain could you tell me where it hurts
[patient] yeah so it's hurting on the inside of my elbow
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and when i i i've been doing some pottery i've been creating you know i have a pottery wheel and i've been i love my pottery and for my son's birthday i've been making a a ceramic bowl and i'm gon na paint it and i have to do some real full decorations but i've really been working on it a lot and my gosh this is hurting and i ca n't work on it right now because it's hurting so much
[doctor] i am so sorry so i mean that's really cool that you do parttery it's something that i've wanted to pick up you know but i do n't know that i have those skills yet does the pain radiate down your arm or up your shoulder or anything
[patient] yeah it does down my arm and along that inside of my arm
[doctor] okay so the medial aspect okay have you did you hit it on anything
[patient] no not that i recall
[doctor] okay and have you ever injured your elbow before
[patient] no i have n't
[doctor] okay alright so on a on a scale of one to ten with ten being your arm is actively being sought off by a chainsaw how bad is the pain
[patient] well i'd say it's about a seven
[doctor] wow that's pretty bad does it keep you up at night
[patient] yes it really does it's you know if i roll over and it it it just wakes me up
[doctor] okay have you done anything to relieve the pain
[patient] well i have been taking some ibuprofen but that is n't really helping
[doctor] okay and have you tried anything like ice or heat or anything else
[patient] i tried a little bit of ice at first
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but and it's just it's been hurting for about four days now
[doctor] okay
[patient] did n't getting better
[doctor] okay okay so it's probably it do you think it's getting worse
[patient] well it's just not getting better
[doctor] okay no i understand okay so i know that you also have like a history of hypertension and that we have you on ten milligrams of lisinopril have you been checking your blood pressures regularly
[patient] yeah you know what i remember too i mean they they have been pretty good one teens to one thirties
[doctor] okay alright and okay do you think that you've been good about taking your medications do you usually take them everyday
[patient] yeah pretty much i i i you know set an alarm for that lisinopril
[doctor] awesome that's great alright and so i see that you also we are treating you for diabetes as well and that we have you on five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day how about that have you been taking that regularly
[patient] well sometimes i forget i mean having a medication twice a day you know sometimes i'm out doing stuff and i just forget to take it
[doctor] okay
[patient] and plus i kinda have a sweet tooth so you know sometimes they're a little bit higher you know like one fifty to one seventy so
[doctor] okay alright so when you say a sweet tooth what are we talking about there
[patient] i love to bak also besides my ceramics i'm really big and baking and i like to make cakes and and take them to you know parties and get togethers you know family get togethers and i like to make senna rules too i've been doing that since i was very young so i kinda noticed that
[doctor] okay cinnamon rolls can be kind of hard like do you for your cakes do you do you use fondant you know to like do any of the decorations
[patient] no i i mine are just pretty basic they're not overly fancy
[doctor] okay
[patient] simpon rolls i got that recipe out of a southern living magazine
[doctor] oof
[patient] a long time ago and
[doctor] so you know it's good
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright well so i totally understand like baking and like the excitement of being able to give those to your family but we maybe wan na start cutting down on eating and taste testing ourselves is do you think that's something we could manage
[patient] yeah i know i need to get better on it i probably could use maybe a refresher on just managing what i should and should n't eat how like if i need to combine a protein you know if i do eat something a little bit sweet maybe pling a protein or something with it
[doctor] mm-hmm yeah that sounds like a
[patient] had some friends tell me something about that
[doctor] yeah that sounds like a great idea and i think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice you know i do n't wan na as much as it's really helpful to have friends i do wan na be able to give you like a source of truth right
[patient] yeah i i had a diabetic consult a long time ago but yeah it it would be nice to see a dietitian again and go over those and maybe there is some new stuff too
[doctor] a hundred percent yeah you know like i one of the things that i struggle with is like are eggs good for you or bad for you you know like with cholesterol i feel like it changes every other year or something like that so you're right there may be some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course would n't hurt but if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any questions or if anything sounds anything that you you want me to expand on further but this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay
[patient] yeah and can i ask you what word what were my vital signs can you show me what my vital signs were
[doctor] yeah that's uh uh that's a really good question so our big and favorite one is gon na be your blood pressure right so you're right like we are seeing some some definite improvement today it was one twenty over seventy and honestly that's a great place to be so that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal so i see it here as eighteen that's wonderful you are not running a fever so ninety seven . nine and you're honestly that's within like a good enough range for me you're satting pretty well your oxygen saturation is a hundred percent again so that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body i do wan na say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about and you're saying that at it's worst your the pain in your elbow is a seven out of ten so that's something that i'm gon na evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well so those are all great do you have any questions about that so far
[patient] no that sounds good yeah i was just curious
[doctor] yeah
[patient] checked it in a while so
[doctor] mm-hmm i do wan na say that like looking at your the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here but that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds so i'm not i'm not i'm not like seriously worried about it but if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually you know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on
[patient] well i do go for some walks in the evening i try to get one in on the morning too
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so not a whole lot other than that because i'm busy with my pottery or baking so but i do try to get out and walk daily
[doctor] okay that's awesome so like how about about how long are your walks
[patient] well i just walk around the neighborhood there is you know the sidewalks and there is kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the bridge and so it's probably you know maybe one to two miles a day
[doctor] wow that's intense i was not expecting that number that's awesome okay alright so maybe this five pounds is muscle we're gon na go for it okay but thank you but that's some really important information but i'm gon na start your physical exam now okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i know that you said that you are experiencing elbow pain could you tell me is it your left or your right elbow
[patient] it's my right
[doctor] okay alright right elbow when i touch it does it hurt on the inside
[patient] yes it does
[doctor] okay so moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle when you turn like when you turn your wrist is if you're trying to open a door knob do you experience pain
[patient] no not really
[doctor] alright so turning out no pain but when you turn your wrist inwards do you have any pain
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay so pain with resisted pronation of right forearm when you rest your arm on a table with the palm side up alright i want you to raise your hand by bending the wrist do you experiencing any pain
[patient] yeah that hurts
[doctor] alright alright so when you are when i'm pressing here and like flexing your wrist are you experiencing any pain
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright pain with flexion and when bending the wrist alright when i listen to you you know i'm just gon na check your heart and lungs everything sounds sounds good no murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear bilaterally to bilaterally to auscultation i'm not noticing any rash for your at your elbow i do n't notice any bruising any swelling we do wan na note that tenderness but otherwise there is no discoloration no lesions so that's good your pulses and are equal bilaterally and i think i think we have an idea of what we are dealing with here okay so i'm gon na go ahead and give you my impression and plan for your your first problem like your primary problem that you are here for is right elbow pain it's consistent with medial epicondylitis and that it just means it's pain caused from overuse and damage to the tendons in your arm what we are gon na do is rest it i'm gon na order a sling for your right arm and you can wear this while you're awake well i want you to apply ice to your elbow for twenty minutes three times a day i'm going to i'm gon na ask you to take six hundred milligrams of ibuprofen that's three pills every six hours with food and you can take that for one week i know it's really important that you said that you have something that a gift that you wan na make for your son but we're gon na hold off on pottery for the next couple of weeks just to give your arm a chance to heal you know like it's awesome that you wan na be able to do these things for your family but sometimes you know your body is not where your where your where your heart is like where your heart and your head are right and then so
[patient] i'll i'll just let him know that that i maybe i'll take a picture of what i have so far
[doctor] absolutely that's awesome and so it'll be like a a movie like coming soon to a shelf near you that's great for your second problem right we have this longstanding diabetes i want to increase your metformin to a thousand milligrams twice a day i know that you're saying you're having a hard time keeping up with that so i want you to do a good job of like checking and recording your blood sugars every day i do need you to follow up with me in a couple weeks i also wan na order something called an a1c since you are having a hard time with like the blood like the blood sugars everyday an a1c will give me a more accurate picture of like a longer period of time and then we might need to evaluate like what are what other options that we have if your sugars if we ca n't get them a bit more under control i do want you to follow up with me in a couple of weeks about the about your diabetes and for your third problem of hypertension we're just gon na continue you on your lisinopril at ten milligrams that's it seems to be doing it's job i'm really i'm really glad about that and it's probably due to the walking that you're doing i forgot to mention for your diabetes we are gon na i'm gon na recommend a a referral to diabetic counseling that way you can get like a bit more information on like the steps that you can take to help you with that
[patient] i was gon na ask you how about my x-ray the x-ray of my elbow how did that look
[doctor] your x-ray honestly looks great in that i do n't see any kind of fracture or bony abnormality so that's what makes me think that this is like a tendon related thing right so in reviewing your x-ray like it it does support the the the assessment and plan that i have given you i
[patient] okay
[doctor] do you
[patient] just true
[doctor] yeah absolutely i do think for your your primary problem the elbow that we might wan na get put you in some physical rehab if the problem is taking a little longer to heal but we'll discuss that at your next visit here okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright no problem any other questions
[patient] nope

"[doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate .
[doctor] hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ?
[patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?
[doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .
[patient] yes . it's doing much better .
[doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?
[patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .
[doctor] okay , that sounds good .
[patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .
[doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?
[patient] no , i'm not right now .
[doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .
[patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .
[doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .
[patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .
[doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .
[patient] okay . i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?
[patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?
[doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?
[patient] twice a day .
[doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?
[patient] no , that's fine .
[doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] how often are you using that one ?
[patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .
[doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?
[patient] i'm not .
[doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?
[patient] no wipes .
[doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?
[patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .
[doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?
[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .
[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .
[patient] it is ? okay .
[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .
[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .
[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .
[patient] yes , i did . thank you .
[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .
[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .
[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] let's see .
[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .
[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .
[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .
[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .
[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .
[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .
[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?
[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .
[patient] can you do the metro market ?
[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .
[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?
[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .
[patient] okay . got it .
[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?
[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .
[doctor] so i will say , "" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . ""
[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?
[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?
[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .
[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .
[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .
[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .
[patient] thank you so much .
[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .
[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?
[patient] yeah , sounds good .
[doctor] do you have enough refills ?
[patient] yeah , i think so .
[doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .
[patient] yes , i do .
[doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .
[patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?
[doctor] yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .
[patient] okay , thank you .
[doctor] okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .","**SOAP Note**

"OK. Ohh, OK.
Hello?
Hello, can you hear me?
Hello. Uh, just before we go any further, can I confirm your name and, age please?
Uh, my name's Itha, and I'm twenty six.
Twenty six, OK. And how can I help you this afternoon?
Um, so basically, I've been really stressed at work for the past few days.
And, I've realised that I've got, really dry itchy skin.
OK. Um, sorry to hear work's been so stressful. Um.
Tell me more about your skin first, Lou. Tell me uh, you mentioned it's been dry and itchy. Um, whereabouts on your skin?
All over my arms, um, and my hands mainly.
OK. Um, and is this something you've had before?
Uh, no. Never had .
So, uh, did it, did it come about quite suddenly, or was it more, kind of a gradual thing?
I think it started a few days ago.
OK. And, has this spread anywhere else? Has it spread to your, to your chest, your legs, your face?

No, OK. So apart from being dry and itchy, um, any other symptoms? Has it been sore? Has it been, uh, have you noticed any cracked skin?
Um, so my skin's quite red, um, and I'm using coconut butter for the past few days.
OK. Has that.
I don't have any spots, and no fever , and I'm not sweating either.
OK.
Thank you, for mentioning all those. Um, OK. Uh, so the coconut butter hasn't helped, with the itch?
No, .

OK. And, uh, you mentioned work's been quite stressful. What do you do for work?
Um, I work as a teacher.
OK. And, uh, in what way has work been stressful?
I think the kids have been really annoying these days.
OK. .
And, I've been working really long hours.
OK, all right. Well I'm sorry to hear that, and I hope it gets better.
Um, going back to your skin. I mean is it anything you've done perhaps, uh, which may have triggered your symptoms? Anything you've touched or, you know, for example shower gels, soaps, fabric , fabric cleaners?
, I went swimming a few days ago.
OK. Is that the first time in your life or have you been before?
Uh, no, I've been before.
OK. And did your symptoms start after you went swimming?
Uh, yes, .
OK, all right. Um, you mentioned you've had no other fevers, is that right? No fevers? No vomiting?
No.
No. How's your health otherwise?
It's pretty good, yeah. I'm not on any medication.
And all , we'll get to medication in just a second. Um, , do you, do you feel generally run-down? Do you feel tired?
Uh, yeah, I think I have been, quite tired.
OK, OK. Are you eating and drinking OK?
Yeah, I've been drinking, and eating as normal.
Your appetite's fine is it? OK. And your bowels, are your bowels working OK?
Yeah.
Uh, no, no problems with vomiting, or loose stools?
No.
OK. And your waterworks are uh, all OK? You're passing urine OK?
Yep.
OK, all right. Um, so just moving on. In terms of your other medical history, is there anything else I should be aware of?
I'm currently taking .
Microgynon.
Yeah.
OK. Do you know what that is?
Uh, no.
OK. , it's a contraceptive pill

Does that make sense? Is that something you're, is that, does that ring a bell now?
Ohh yeah.
OK. Is there, any other medications that you take?
Uh, no.
No. So, in terms of your medical history, there's no, problems of skin problems in the past, things like eczema or, um, dermatitis?
Uh, no, I think it might just be the weather.
Sorry what was that? You think it's.
The .
I think it might just be the weather.
The weather?
Yeah, .
Ohh, you think the , OK. You think the weather, OK.
OK. No that's OK, no, no problems. Well um, uh, move . Do you, do you suffer from allergies? Are you someone who suffers from allergies?
Um.
Food allergies? Medication allergies?
I think, um, I might be lactose intolerant.
Lactose intolerant, OK, that could be helpful to know. Um, fine. And tell me of family history, is there anything in the family that you're aware of?
Um, yeah, so um, my dad has asthma, and, my mum has hayfever.
Hayfever, OK. Um, fine, but any, again, any skin problems that you're aware of?
Yep.
Uh, no.
No, OK, all right. Socially, who do you live with at home?
Ohh, it's just me.
Live alone?
Yep.
And, uh, do you smoke at all? Do you, can I ask? Do you smoke? Are you a smoker?
Uh, no, I don't smoke.
Do you drink much in the way of alcohol?
Uh, no.
Recreational drugs?
No.
OK. And you said you , you work as a primary school teacher?
Yes, that's right.
Uh , the reason I ask is sometimes stress can be a , contributing factor. Um, you felt, you noticed yourself, find, uh, , life's been more stressful recently. Is that right?
Do you think that might have any correlation to your symptoms?
I don't. I certainly think so.
OK, all right. Um, fine. Um.
OK, well, normally at this stage I like to proceed to examination, but um, based on your uh, story.
Um, it's difficult. I think that, you know, , you've, essentially the story is you've got a dry itchy rash on your, mainly your hands. you mentioned. Um and your arms which started, perhaps after swimming a few days ago.
Um, but no other symptoms, you're feeling otherwise, well, no fevers, no bleeding or discharge from skin.
Yep.
I wonder whether you may have something called dermatitis. Um, have you heard of that condition before?
I have, yeah.
OK. Um, great. Well I can give you a patient information leaflet about that, which gives a bit more information about the disease, but, um, it, it's something that we can readily treated. Um.
With couple options, we have steroid creams I can give you, um, which will help with the inflammation.
And, uh, something called emollients, which can help with the dry, dry skin.
And that's something you just need to kind of paste on, uh, on to your skin, uh, , throughout the day for the next few days. Um, and hopefully that helps your symptoms.
OK, it's cool. Thank you very much.
Um, , you can also try antihistamines, so you can get things over the counter, Piriton, Loratadine, they can sometimes help with the itchiness.
Yeah, that sounds good.
OK. And um, that's probably what I recommend. Paracetamol on this occasion, wouldn't be helpful.
Um, uh, uh, painkillers wouldn't be helpful , on this occasion, but let's, let's, let's see how the next few days go.
And if it's still not getting better, come back and see me next week, and we can have another look again, at your symptoms.
OK, perfect. Thank you very much.
Right. Do you have any questions for me?
Uh, no.
OK. Well, I wish you all the best. Have a good day.
Well, thank you very much. Bye.
Thank you. Bye bye.","**History and Physical (H&P)**

"[doctor] thanks , rachel . nice , nice to meet you .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] um , as my nurse told you , we're using dax . so i'm just gon na tell dax a little bit about you .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so rachel is a 48-year-old female here for shortness of breath . she has a history of depression , smoking , and chronic back pain . so tell me about this shortness of breath .
[patient] okay . so there are times when i'm either doing very , very mild exercises or just walking , even if i'm just walking up , you know , my driveway , i find myself palpitating a lot , and there's a little bit of shortness of breath .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] i do n't know if it's got to do with the back pain , you know , whether that gets triggered as well at the same time .
[doctor] right .
[patient] but definitely i feel it happens more often lately .
[doctor] okay . and anything else change recently ? like , have you changed lifestyle , like you're exercising more than you used to , having any allergies , anything like that ?
[patient] probably exercising more to get rid of the covid 15 .
[doctor] the covid 15 . yeah . now last time i saw you , you were smoking two packs a day . how much are you smoking now ?
[patient] um , it's gone down quite a bit because , yeah , we said we have to make some , you know , changes as you get older .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] so i would say it's probably , um , maybe , maybe a couple ... probably a coup- i do n't know . probably once or day or something .
[doctor] just couple cigarettes a day ?
[patient] probably once a day , yeah .
[doctor] we're getting close .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] that's awesome .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] that's great news . um , and then how's your depression doing ?
[patient] i have my moments .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] there are some days when i feel , you know , i wake up and everything was great .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] and then there are times , i do n't , i do n't know whether it's got to do with the weather or what else kind of triggers it .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] there are some days when i feel extremely low .
[doctor] okay . and you had been taking the effexor for your depression . are you still taking that ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] okay , great . and then , um the chronic back pain , we've been giving you the gabapentin neurontin for that . is that helping control the pain ?
[patient] i think it is .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] it is ... it's definitely , um , i feel better .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] but it does come every now and then .
[doctor] right . what do you do when it's really bad ?
[patient] um , i try to just get as much rest as i can .
[doctor] okay . and you had talked about doing yoga . are you doing yoga anymore ?
[patient] i wish i said yes , but i have n't really made it a habit .
[doctor] okay . okay . well , um , you know , said ... you said you were coming in with shortness of breath , so we sent you to get some pulmonary function tests .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so let's just look at those . hey , dragon , show me the pulmonary function tests . okay , so it looks like ... , it's interesting . it says that you might be having a little bit of asthma or , uh , copd . and if you are , we'll talk about that .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] let's look at our x-ray . hey , dragon , show me the most recent x-ray . okay , i said it wrong . hey , dragon , show me the most recent chest x-ray . okay , this is interesting . your ... kind of your diaphragm is a little bit flatter , and we'll see that in some , uh , copd , which happens with smokers often . so let's just do a quick physical exam . i know my nurse did the review of systems with you . is there anything else bothering you that we need to talk about today ?
[patient] no other issues .
[doctor] okay . great . let's do the exam . all right , so your physical exam looks pretty normal other than you've got kind of these mild wheezes in all your lung fields . and so i think you do have copd from your pulmonary function tests , your x-ray , and that . so i'm gon na diagnose you with copd . chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . it means you're not able to exhale appropriately .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so we're gon na put you on a medicine called combivent . okay , you're gon na do two puffs twice a day . it's gon na help open up your lungs . it's an inhaler .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i'm also gon na prescribe albuterol , which you use when you get really short of breath . it's like a rescue thing .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] um , and then i'm gon na prescribe some steroids to help , also some prednisone . so let me just order those .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon , order combivent , uh , two puffs twice a day . order albuterol , two puffs as needed . and order , uh , prednisone uh taper pack . okay , so and then it sounds like your depression's stable , so we're not gon na change anything . you're gon na keep taking the effexor . um , do yoga for depression and your back pain , so for your back pain , stay on the neurontin , and we just wo n't do anything different . any questions for me .
[patient] no , i think this is good . thank you .
[doctor] perfect . hey , dragon , finalize the note . why do n't you ...","**Clinical Note**

"[doctor] next is betty hill , uh , date of birth is 2/21/1968 . she has a past medical history of uterine fibroids and anemia . she's a new patient with a referral from the er of esophagitis . um , i reviewed our records from the er , including the normal cardiac workup , and we're about to go in and see her now . good morning . you miss hill ?
[patient] good morning . yes . that's me .
[doctor] hey , i'm dr. sanders . it's nice to meet you .
[patient] nice to meet you too .
[doctor] so tell me about what brings you in today ?
[patient] well , i really needed to see you three months ... three months ago , but this was your first available appointment . when i called to make the appointment , i was having chest pains , but it stopped after four days , and i have n't had any since then .
[doctor] okay . when did these four days of chest pain occur ?
[patient] um , early october .
[doctor] of 2020 , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . can you think of anything that might have caused the chest pain ? did you wake up with it ?
[patient] no . it just it randomly . i tolerated it for four days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieved it . they did a bunch of testing and did n't find anything .
[doctor] okay . can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ?
[patient] well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp .
[doctor] did they prescribe you any medications in the er ?
[patient] no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal .
[doctor] okay . i see .
[patient] they thought it was something to do with the gi system , so that's why they referred me here .
[doctor] interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ?
[patient] uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like .
[doctor] was the pain worse with eating or exercise ?
[patient] yes . with eating .
[doctor] okay . any difficulty swallowing ?
[patient] mm-hmm . i did .
[doctor] okay . and that's also resolved since the initial episode three months ago ?
[patient] yes . thankfully . the chest pain and swallowing problem got better about three days after i went to the er . but i just feel like there's something wrong .
[doctor] okay . so how has your weight been .
[patient] i've been trying to lose weight .
[doctor] that's good . any in- ... issues with abdominal pain ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . good . and how about your bowel movements ; are they okay ?
[patient] they're normal .
[doctor] all right . are you aware of any family history of gi problems ?
[patient] i do n't think so .
[doctor] have had you had any surgeries on your abdomen , or gall bladder , or appendix ?
[patient] yes . they took my gall bladder out several years ago .
[doctor] okay . if you wan na lay down here on the table for me and lets take a look at you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so when i push on your lower belly , do you have any pain , or does it feel tender ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . how about up here in your upper abdomen ?
[patient] yes . it , it hurts a little .
[doctor] okay . and even when i press lightly like this ?
[patient] yes . uh , just a little uncomfortable .
[doctor] okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ?
[patient] i'd say it's about the same .
[doctor] okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good .
[patient] okay . good .
[doctor] so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days .
[patient] well , since you mention anxiety , i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time this happened .
[doctor] okay . that's good to know . so stress from this could be , um ... could be , uh ... could be very well have contributed to your condition .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so we could do an , uh , egd or upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis . but your symptoms occurred three months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes , so likely if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point ... by this point , and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor , uh , for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd . uh , with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option . but what do you think ?
[patient] i'd like to hold off on the egd and wait to see if i have more symptoms .
[doctor] that sounds good . um , so you can call the office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we'll get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow up with me ... follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right ? if you do n't have any questions for me , i'll walk you out to the check-out desk .
[patient] no . that's it . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . right this way . all right . uh , in assessment , please summarize the patient's history briefly , and let's list her possible etiologies such as , uh , gerd , dyspepsia , esophagitis , musculoskeletal etiologies , and anxiety . uh , suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition , plus or minus a contribution from her musculoskeletal etiologies . um , in the plan , include our discussion of the egd versus monderning ... monitoring for symptom . patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change . thanks .","**Clinical Note: Betty Hill**

"Hi, good morning!
Hello there!
Hi there, this is uh this is Doctor Dean from .
Hello there? Um, I'm wondering if you can help me today.

OK, sure, I'll try. Before we start, could I please confirm your full name and date of birth?
Yes, it's Sarah Smith, and it's the second of November, um, nineteen ninety two.
That's great! Thank you, sir. So are you in a private place where you are OK to speak at the moment?
I am indeed, yes.
OK, so tell me what's been going on.
OK. I, I've really not been feeling so well at all recently. I, I've been struggling with fever for the past week. Yeah, I would say it's about seven days ago. I'm just, I'm really hot and sweaty all the time, and just generally not feeling good.
OK, alright, sorry to hear that. Now, um, uh, along with this fever and this any other symptoms at all?
Um, I'd say that I'm aching all over really, my muscles are really aching. I'm feeling quite nauseous, uh, so I've not been able to eat very much, and I have been drinking but it's been quite a small amount.
Um, and, yeah, just generally quite tired and unwell. I'm sweating during the the the night, I'm quite cold.

OK, all right. Um, and um, so you're having periods of when you're feeling hot, and also periods when you're feeling cold as well.
Yes, yes, quite interchangeable, not really a pattern to it.
OK, uh, and have you been taking your medication?
Uh, I've been trying to, like, take ibuprofen and paracetamol just to from over the counter, but it's not really helping, just been taking the recommended dose every day of those.
Sure, and when you say it's not helping, is it bringing the temperature down at all?
Perhaps slightly, yes, but I'm still experiencing these symptoms, so, it does take the edge off a bit.
OK, alright. And can I just double check have you gotten any cough or cold or sore throat or anything like that?
Mmm, not those sort of symptoms, really. Um
But which are you getting, other than the ones you've already mentioned to me?
Um, so, I have a habit
that it's mainly just the sweating, really, and the and the nausea, uh, that's overtaking all all day and, uh, the aching muscles all over.
Sure. Have you have you had any ear pain ?
Mmm, no, my ears are fine, actually. I haven't had any problems with my ears.
OK, um, just, I just need to check for any other causes of infection in the body. So I'm gonna go through some, um, kind of systemic questions. Have you had any diarrhoea?
And not, not really no, not that I can find.
OK. Have you got any neck stiffness at all?
Um, no. My neck's, my neck's been fine.
OK.
Alright. Um, do you have any headache?
Not more than usual, no. Just like the, general headaches but not, just from staring at the screen. No migraines, or anything.
OK.
OK, so, you know your normal headache, where is that, in the back of your head or the front of the head?
Uum, it's quite centralized over, over the head.
OK. and how long have you been having that for?

It's something that I've struggled with through, years really, just related to a screen use, or, uum, like changes in weather patterns. Yeah, high pressure days, sometimes I struggle with migraines, and headaches.

OK. Um, have you got any rash on your body anywhere at all?
Uh, I haven't noticed any rashes, no.
Uh, any joints swollen or tender or sore?
Mmm, not really. I mean, I, I often have problems with back pain but not really any other joints.
OK, alright.
Any problems?
Alright, and, um, have you got any kind of symptoms down below when you're passing urine?
Uh, no, there's been no problems there.
OK. Any painful urination at all?
Uh, not at all, no.
Are you passing urine more often than normal?
Uh, I don't think so, no it's been fairly regular.
OK. Have you been abroad anywhere recently?
Yes, I have actually.
Where have you been?
I went to Vietnam. Uh, I came back four weeks ago now.
OK.
Uh, and, um, uh, did you take malaria preventative medication when you went out there?
I did, yes.
Which one did you take?
Ooo, I can't remember now, off the top of my head.
Was it a weekly tablet or a daily tablet?
I think it was daily.
OK, um, and was it one tablet or was it another one that you would take on top of the first one?
I think it was, uh another one that I took on top of the first one.
OK.
And, and what were you doing out in Vietnam? Was it just seeing the cities or going through villages or hiking? What what kind of activities were you doing?
It was quite really, 'cause we were there for a few weeks, and we toured to, uh, several different parts of the country, and uh, the countryside and some cities as well.
OK. Uh, and um, did you do any kind of, were you in rivers or things like that? Were you, you know, how adventurous were you?
I'm sorry, could you repeat that? I missed that.
Where you going out into the rivers? Were you going on beaches? I mean how adventurous was your trip?
Yes, it was quite adventurous. We were sort of trekking and, um, cycling, uh, through the farmland and, um, seeing how people lived in a day-to-day life in, in, in farmland.
Right, OK. Um, thank you for sharing that with me. Now, do you have, um, any other illnesses at all, in the past?
Mmm, as I said I've, I've been struggling with back pain for quite a while, but I haven't really had any, uh, major illnesses in the past, I can think of.
And that back pain have you, um, have you seen anyone about that?
Yes, yeah, I'm under a physiotherapist at the moment for that.
Have they, have they give you any kind of diagnosis at all?
Um, they've said that it's, u,h related to long periods of time sitting at a desk, and just, uh, bad posture. So mainly the exercises are focused on improving posture and, and to strengthen the muscles in the back.
Alright um, are there any illnesses in your family at all?
Hmm, the main one would be, um, heart attack. My, my father passed away of that.
I'm sorry to hear that. Um, how old was he when that happened?
in his sixties.
Um, sixty eight, I think. Yeah.
OK. Um, are you on any medication at all?
Uh, just Seroxat.
OK. Uh, do you have any allergies at all? medication?
No, I've just really pollen allergy. That's all I have.
OK, so hay fever.
Yes, yeah, just hay fever.
Alright. Um, are you, um, you're working at the moment?
Uh, I am, yes.
What do you work at?
I work as a nurse.
OK, all right. Um, and, um, you're up to date with all the vaccinations, Hepatitis B, and that kind of thing?
Yes, indeed. Yeah.
OK.
But I'm, I'm really struggling quite a lot at work at the moment. It's been quite difficult, feeling so, uh, tired all the time.
So, I can .
Sure, OK. Um, and, are you a, uh, are you a smoker at all?
No, I'm not.
OK, and ohh do you drink much alcohol?
Mmm, moderate alcohol intake. Yeah, I don't drink too much.
OK, and how much kind of physical exercise do you do normally?
I try and do, uh, some moderate physical exercise a few times a week.
OK, that's good, alright, um, so, um
What, uh, I think we're gonna need to do is we're gonna need to bring you into one of our clinics. Examine , and we're gonna need to arrange some blood tests as well.
OK.
OK, um, so, what what I want to do is, the first question I have in my mind is that we need to find a reason for why you've got this fever and these symptoms, because there's no apparent reason from what you've told me.
OK.
There's no, uh, when someone has got fever and sweats, we want to find out have they got chest infection, have they got a throat infection?
Um, and if we can't find a focus of infection, then that's something, that, that's an outstanding question that needs to be answered, OK?
Um, the second thing, second factor, is that you've recently come from, uh, Vietnam.
OK.
And you've had exposure to rural areas. And we need to think about things like malaria or other exotic infections as well. So, um, you're probably gonna need some blood tests.
After you've been seen by somebody.
Um, now, the urgency of those blood tests depends partly on what we find when we examine you, which is why we're going to go, go for the examination first.
You come into one of our clinics in central London, that's one option, and then the the GP there who examines you can then decide on how urgent the blood tests and things are going to be.
OK.
Or, if it's inconvenient for you to come into central London because you you're living further out, you could actually just attend a local A and E.
I'm going to type up what my thought process is and what kind of test I think you need in the notes for this appointment, so you could show that to them at reception.
Um, I'll be asking for something called thick and thin blood films, to check for malaria.
And inflammatory markers and things like those, technical terms, but they'll understand what that, what I'm talking about.
But, um, I, I don't think you can go into work, uh, until we've sorted this out. And we, we, we need to sort this out sooner rather than later.
OK. That sounds great. Thank you so much for your help. I, I think, yeah, I can come straight into central London today to get that sorted.
OK.
OK, fine, so what I'm going to do is I will send a message to one of our admin team members asking them to book you in.
And if you can ring the number that I leave in your consultation notes, after a few minutes, and then they'll slot you in, and then we can sort things out from there. OK?
That's brilliant. Thank you very much.
Alright then, OK. Take care then. All the best.
Goodbye.
Bye.","Sarah Smith, 30 years old, presented with a 7-day history of fever, chills, sweating, generalized myalgias, nausea, fatigue, and intermittent cold/hot flushes. Symptoms persisted despite ibuprofen and paracetamol use (recommended doses daily), with minimal temperature reduction. No cough, sore throat, or rhinorrhea noted. Nausea limited oral intake, but hydration was maintained. No neck stiffness, headache (non-migrainous, centralized, exacerbated by screen use and weather changes), rash, joint swelling, or urinary symptoms.  

Travel history: Returned from Vietnam 4 weeks ago, engaged in rural trekking, cycling, and exposure to farmland. Took malaria prophylaxis (daily regimen, unspecified medication). No documented mosquito bites or fever during travel. Family history: Father died of myocardial infarction at 68. No other significant medical history except chronic back pain (postural/ergonomic origin, managed by physiotherapy).  

Current medications: Seroxat. Allergies: Pollen (hay fever). No smoking or excessive alcohol use. Moderate physical activity 3–4 times weekly. Vaccinations up to date (including Hepatitis B).  

Clinical concerns: Fever with chills, night sweats, and systemic symptoms raise suspicion for infectious etiology, including malaria (given travel history and rural exposure). No localized infection focus identified. Urgent evaluation and blood tests recommended, including thick/thin blood films for malaria, inflammatory markers, and complete blood count. Patient advised to avoid work until further assessment.

### **Hospital Course**  
An 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension, stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a prior history of chronic heart failure (CHF) was admitted for acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. The patient presented with progressive bilateral ankle edema, worsening dyspnea, and a 911 call. Emergency department (ED) evaluation revealed a blood pressure of 200/90 mmHg.  

During hospitalization, the patient was managed with intravenous diuretics (furosemide), oral diuretics (bumetanide 2 mg daily), and titrated antihypertensive medications. He reported significant improvement in symptoms, including resolution of dyspnea and edema.  

A physical examination revealed trace bilateral lower extremity edema, a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur (stable), and no jugular venous distention. Vital signs were stable: BP 128/72 mmHg, heart rate 79 bpm, respiratory rate 26 (attributed to conversation), and O2 saturation 99% on room air.  

Echocardiogram findings included preserved ejection fraction (EF 55%), abnormal diastolic filling, and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.  

---

### **Discharge Diagnosis**  
1. **Acute on Chronic Heart Failure (CHF)**  
   - **Cause**: Dietary indiscretion (excessive sodium intake, including pizza and chicken wings) and uncontrolled hypertension.  
2. **Hypertension**  
   - **Management**: Continue cozaar 100 mg daily and norvasc 5 mg once daily.  
   - **Additional Testing**: Renal artery ultrasound ordered to rule out secondary causes.  
3. **Stage III Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)**  
   - **Monitoring**: Repeat labs to assess renal function and medication tolerance.  

---

### **Disposition Plan**  
**Medications**:  
- **Bumetanide 2 mg daily** (continued for edema management).  
- **Cozaar 100 mg daily** (for hypertension).  
- **Norvasc 5 mg once daily** (for hypertension).  

**Dietary Restrictions**:  
- **Low-sodium diet** (avoid salty foods, including pizza and chicken wings).  
- **Nutritionist referral** for tailored dietary education.  

**Monitoring**:  
- **Daily weight tracking** with immediate reporting of ≥3 lb weight gain in 2 days.  
- **Home BP monitoring** using a purchased cuff; report readings to provider.  

**Follow-Up**:  
- **Renal artery ultrasound** scheduled to evaluate for secondary hypertension.  
- **Labs**: Repeat renal function tests (eGFR, BUN, creatinine) to monitor CKD.  
- **Provider follow-up**: Scheduled in 3 months.  

**Patient Education**:  
- Avoid excessive fluid intake and monitor for symptoms of CHF (e.g., dyspnea, edema).  
- Continue medication adherence, including antihypertensives.  
- Limit alcohol and sodium intake to prevent exacerbations.  

---  
**Discharge Status**: Stable, no acute symptoms, adherent to discharge instructions.  
**Signed**: [Attending Physician Name]  
**Date**: [Redacted]","**Discharge Summary**  

**Hospital Course**:  
The patient, an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension and stage 3 chronic kidney disease, was admitted for acute on chronic heart failure exacerbation. He presented with bilateral ankle swelling, progressive dyspnea, and required non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) per paramedics. Emergency department blood pressure was 200/90 mmHg. Upon admission, the patient reported inconsistent medication adherence, with occasional missed doses of antihypertensives. He acknowledged dietary indiscretion, including frequent consumption of high-sodium foods (e.g., pizza, chicken wings) at social gatherings.  

During hospitalization, the patient received intravenous furosemide (Bumex), oral diuretics, and optimized antihypertensive therapy (Cozaar 100 mg, Norvasc 5 mg). He reported significant improvement in dyspnea and functional status. A physical exam revealed trace bilateral lower extremity edema, preserved ejection fraction (55%), abnormal diastolic filling, and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation on echocardiogram. Vital signs were stable at discharge: BP 128/72 mmHg, HR 79, RR 26, O2 sat 99%.  

**Discharge Diagnosis**:  
1. **Acute on chronic heart failure** (secondary to dietary indiscretion and uncontrolled hypertension).  
2. **Hypertension** (stage 2, requiring ongoing management).  
3. **Stage 3 chronic kidney disease** (monitoring required).  

**Disposition Plan**:  
- Continue Bumex 2 mg daily, Cozaar 100 mg, and Norvasc 5 mg.  
- Monitor daily weight and BP; report ≥3 lb weight gain in 2 days.  
- Avoid high-sodium foods; refer to nutritionist for dietary education.  
- Order renal artery ultrasound to rule out secondary hypertension.  
- Repeat labs for renal function.  
- Follow-up in 3 months.  
- No chest pain, dyspnea, or sleep disturbances reported post-discharge. Patient adheres to prescribed regimen.","**Structure**: The note must be a hospital Discharge Summary covering the Hospital Course, Discharge Diagnosis, and Disposition Plan."
"Hello.
Hi there, it's Doctor Smith from Babylon. Can you confirm your name, date of birth and your address, please?

Did you have to miss school?
Uh, yeah, occasionally.
OK. And when do you think it last, when do you think that asthma stopped? At what age did you get to a point where you weren't taking medication anymore?
Mmm.
Few years ago, like, three or four years ago I think? Yeah.

And so this time, how did it start? Did you have any other symptoms? Any chest pain, temperature, cold symptoms, anything like that?
Yeah, so I have, I have cough and cough a lot, and I have a fever. Um, I also used to walk to work but recently I can't because it's, I, I feel like very short of breath and sometimes I feel like I can't even finish sentence is quite difficult to, to complete the, the the talking sometimes, yeah. Occasionally.
Right. Have you coughed any phlegm up or anything like that?
No.
Any, any, um, blood in there when you cough?
No, I don't think so.
OK. And any chest pain?
No chest pain, no.
Have you been woken up at night time at all?
No, just daytime working, yeah.
Have you been able to do any exercise?
No, I can't.
OK, and do you have a peak flow meter at home, where you measure your breathing?
Sorry?
You have what's called a peak flow meter, which you breathe into to get a score on your breathing?
No, no.
And do you normally take any asthma inhalers over the last few years?
Yes, yeah.
You do? So you said you stopped them three to four years ago?

Ohh, um, when I had asthma I used to take this inhaler, yeah.
OK. How about over the last three to four years?
Yeah.
Have you taken any medication?
Um, I took salbutamol? Salbutamol? Yeah.
OK, so you, you normally take that do you? Or is that just recently?
Normally, yeah.

Yeah, yeah, a bit.
Pardon?
Yeah.
OK, um, and do you take any other medications?

Do you drink any alcohol regularly?
Yeah, one glass.

Every two or three days? Depends, yeah.
And who do you live with at home?
Yeah.
Who do you live with at home?
Yeah, .
Who do you live with, do you live on your own, or do you live with
I live with my partner.
OK, and what's your job, day-to-day?
Uh, I'm engineer.
And have you been at work in the last few days?
No I can't because I used to walk walk to work, but recently I, I work from home or sometimes I take sick leave, yeah.
OK, and when, at the moment, are you, um, feeling short of breath when you're sitting still? Or just when you walk?
No.
Just walk or sometimes, but currently I feel, I feel well.
Are you able to get up and down the stairs OK?
Yeah.
Right, OK. Um, and did you say you were finding it hard to complete your sentences?
Yeah, sometimes.
OK, um.
Yeah, , days, yeah.
Right, OK. Um, I mean, it sounds like you've had a flare up of your asthma. It could be, um, triggered by, if there's more pollen around, or there may be, you may have a viral infection, causing it to get worse.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Did you say you checked your temperature already?
Yes, I checked, I have fever .
Was it normal?
Yeah, yeah.
What was your temperature?
Uh, thirty seven, yeah.
OK, that's fine. Um, have you got an asthma inhaler at home?
Yeah.
OK. So what I would suggest is you take it more regularly than you are doing at the moment. Have you got, um, a spacer at home?
Mm-hmm.
Um, do you want to show me how to do it or somehow?
Um, do you have a spacer at home?
No.
OK. Um, what I can do is, I can prescribe you a peak flow meter so we can check your breathing level and a spacer to use your inhaler a bit more efficiently, which the pharmacist can show you how you use that when you pick it up.
Yeah, sure.
Um, and if you increase it so you're taking it two to four puffs, like, every four hours?
Mm-hmm.
Initially, um, if you get a high temperature or your wheezing is getting worse, you need to call us back straightaway so we can just advise you further with that.
OK.
And it will be a good idea when you're feeling better if we can arrange just a review, just to see how your asthma is, because we may need to start some other medication for you.
OK, sounds good, yeah.
You could arrange a review in a week or so, um, but, but before that and if you're, if you're feeling worse.
In a week, right? OK.
OK, and the other thing to do would be to take a regular antihistamine.
Mm-hmm.
Which you can get from the pharmacy, I can put a on your notes about what to take.
Yeah.
Yeah, they'll be helpful.
And then if you, when you get the peak flow meter, if you can take, the pharmacist can show you how to use it, and if you can record a value first thing when you wake up.
Mm-hmm.
And in the evening over the next week, and then we can discuss that over the phone when we look at the figures and see whether you need to go on another inhaler as well.
Oh, awesome, thank you.
Have you got any questions?
Um, no, that's fine, yeah, thank you very much.
Thanks a lot, bye.","**Clinical Note**
